            "content": "A new kind of Industrial Revolution could already be well underway into a sustained state, defying more typical formations of cyclical boom and bust periods in tech. Meanwhile, AI continues to be ascendant \u2013 or at least the current version of neural networks trained on large data sets that drives developments like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude. One topic keeps coming up in conversations I\u2019m having with technologists, executives, industry leader and frontline workers on all sides of both trends: Specifically, how much the AI boom is complicit in the great and continued culling. Everyone seems to agree that the advent and uptake of AI is playing some part in at least the scope of the layoffs, if not in the timing, which more likely is attributable to overall economic uncertainty. Companies are certainly crowing about the benefits in efficiency new AI products can and are bringing to businesses, but few actually mention them in the specific context of layoffs \u2013 though news about AI replacing at least some of those losing their jobs is making its way out despite efforts to keep that under wraps. Salesforce is laying off around 700 people in its most recent tranche of job cuts, which adds to the group it announced it was cutting last year. SAP, too, announced a massive restructuring but stressed that it anticipates headcount will be the same by end of year. That\u2019s a lot of massaging of the message, but the real story is that these massive companies would typically grow year-over-year, so even flat hiring with restructuring, some buy-outs and backfill hires is a step back from business-as-usual. Both these companies, and many of the other massive tech firms currently suffering through layoffs have also signalled and/or announced sizeable investments in AI to help augment or replace work currently being done by people. Typically these announcements are accompanied by assurances that automating certain tasks will lead to actual human resources being deployed in roles and for jobs that are much more fulfilling, creative and meaningful. Long-term, that may be the case, but right now it\u2019s all \u2018regrettable\u2019 downsizing alongside massive, budget-busting spend on AI products and innovation, with no silver lining in sight about when those generate whole new roles and opportunities for those workers displaced in the meantime. There are plenty of comforting examples out there of how generative AI is still lacking in many regards when it comes to comparing them with actual people \u2013 but there are just as many, if not more, examples of how people are happily using tools like ChatGPT for their real work everyday, with results that are at least satisfactory, if not better than what they were able to do before. Technology revolutions are always disruptive and displace tons of people, but this one seems unique in that the technology it promises doesn\u2019t just augment human efficiency in specific roles in all cases \u2013 it actively replaces an entire function in many. There\u2019s a need for greater transparency about when AI will occupy roles people once did as these large companies continue their roll-out, but we\u2019re unlikely to get that in the midst of the action: More likely it\u2019ll be studied and uncovered later by researchers trying to assess the impact."

            "content": "Will AI automate human jobs, and \u2014 if so \u2014 which jobs and when? That\u2019s the trio of questions a new research study from MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), out this morning, tries to answer. There\u2019s been many attempts to extrapolate out and project how the AI technologies of today, like large language models, might impact people\u2019s\u2019 livelihoods \u2014 and whole economies \u2014 in the future. Goldman Sachs estimates that AI could automate 25% of the entire labor market in the next few years. According to McKinsey, nearly half of all work will be AI-driven by 2055. A survey from the University of Pennsylvania, NYU and Princeton finds that ChatGPT alone could impact around 80% of jobs. And a report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas suggests that AI is already replacing thousands of workers. But in their study, the MIT researchers sought to move beyond what they characterize as \u201ctask-based\u201d comparisons and assess how feasible it is that AI will perform certain roles \u2014 and how likely businesses are to actually replace workers with AI tech. Contrary to what one (including this reporter) might expect, the MIT researchers found that the majority of jobs previously identified as being at risk of AI displacement aren\u2019t, in fact, \u201ceconomically beneficial\u201d to automate \u2014 at least at present. The key takeaway, says Neil Thompson, a research scientist at MIT CSAIL and a co-author on the study, is that the coming AI disruption might happen slower \u2014 and less dramatically \u2014 than some commentators are suggesting. \u201cLike much of the recent research, we find significant potential for AI to automate tasks,\u201d Thompson told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cBut we\u2019re able to show that many of these tasks are not yet attractive to automate.\u201d Now, in an important caveat, the study only looked at jobs requiring visual analysis \u2014 that is, jobs involving tasks like inspecting products for quality at the end of a manufacturing line. The researchers didn\u2019t investigate the potential impact of text- and image-generating models, like ChatGPT and Midjourney, on workers and the economy; they leave that to follow-up studies. In conducting this study, the researchers surveyed workers to understand what an AI system would have to accomplish, task-wise, to fully replace their jobs. They then modeled the cost of building an AI system capable of doing all this, and also modeled whether businesses \u2014 specifically \u201cnon-farm\u201d U.S.-based businesses \u2014 would be willing to pay both the upfront and operating expenses for such a system. Early in the study, the researchers give the example of a baker. A baker spends about 6% of their time checking food quality, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2014 a task that could be (and is being) automated by AI. A bakery employing five bakers making $48,000 per year could save $14,000 were it to automate food quality checks. But by the study\u2019s estimates, a bare-bones, from-scratch AI system up to the task would cost $165,000 to deploy and $122,840 per year to maintenance\u2026 on the low end. \u201cWe find that only 23% of the wages being paid to humans for doing vision tasks would be economically attractive to automate with AI,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cHumans are still the better economic choice for doing these parts of jobs.\u201d Now, the study does account for self-hosted, self-service AI systems sold through vendors like OpenAI that only need to be fine-tuned to particular tasks \u2014 not trained from the ground up. But according to the researchers, even with a system costing as little as $1,000, there\u2019s lots of jobs \u2014 albeit low-wage and multitasking-dependent \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t make economic sense for a business to automate. \u201cEven if we consider the impact of computer vision just within vision tasks, we find that the rate of job loss is lower than that already experienced in the economy,\u201d the researchers write in the study. \u201cEven with rapid decreases in cost of 20% per year, it would still take decades for computer vision tasks to become economically efficient for firms.\u201d The study has a number of limitations, which the researchers \u2014 to their credit \u2014 admit. For example, it doesn\u2019t consider cases where AI can augment rather than replace human labor (e.g. analyze an athlete\u2019s golf swing) or create new tasks and jobs (e.g. maintaining an AI system) that didn\u2019t exist before. Moreover, it doesn\u2019t factor in all the possible cost savings that can come from pre-trained models like GPT-4. One wonders whether the researchers might\u2019ve felt pressure to reach certain conclusions by the study\u2019s backer, the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. The MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab was created with a $240 million, 10-year gift from IBM, a company with a vested interest in ensuring that AI\u2019s perceived as non-threatening. But the researchers assert this isn\u2019t the case. \u201cWe were motivated by the enormous success of deep learning, the leading form of AI, across many tasks and the desire to understand what this would mean for the automation of human jobs,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cFor policymakers, our results should reinforce the importance of preparing for AI job automation \u2026 But our results also reveal that this process will take years, or even decades, to unfold and thus that there is time for policy initiatives to be put into place. For AI researchers and developers, this work points to the importance of decreasing the costs of AI deployments and of increasing the scope of how they can be deployed. These will be important for making AI economically attractive for firms to use for automation.\u201d"

            "content": "Why we should remember that 'inevitable' never is , and with it, a renewed interest in artificial intelligence, which seems like it\u2019ll probably continue to enjoy at least middling hype throughout the year. Of course, it\u2019s being cheerled by techno-zealot billionaires and the flunkies bunked within their cosy islands of influence, primarily in Silicon Valley \u2013 and derided by fabulists who stand to gain from painting the still-fictional artificial general intelligence (AGI) as humanity\u2019s ur-bogeyman for the ages. Both of these positions are exaggerated and untenable, e/acc vs. decel arguments be damned. Speed without caution only ever results in compounding problems that proponents often suggest are best-solved by pouring on more speed, possibly in a different direction, to arrive at some idealized future state where the problems of the past are obviated by the super powerful Next Big Thing of the future; calls to abandon or regress entire areas of innovation meanwhile ignore the complexity of a globalized world where cats generally can not be put back into boxes universally, among many, many other issues with that kind of approach. The long, thrilling and tumultuous history of technology development, particularly in the age of the personal computer and the internet, has shown us that in our fervor for something new, we often neglect to stop and ask \u2018but is the new thing also something we want or need.\u2019 We never stopped to ask that question with things like Facebook, and they ended up becoming an inextricable part of the fabric of society, an eminently manipulable but likewise essential part of crafting and sharing in community dialog. Here\u2019s the main takeaway from the rise of social media that we should carry with us into the advent of the age of AI: Just because something is easier or more convenient doesn\u2019t make it preferable \u2014 or even desirable. LLM-based so-called \u2018AI\u2019 has already infiltrated our lives in ways that will likely prove impossible to wind back, even if we wanted to do such a thing, but that doesn\u2019t mean we have to indulge in the escalation some see as inevitable, wherein we relentlessly rip out human equivalents of some of the gigs that AI is already good at, or shows promise in, to make way for the necessary \u2018forward march of progress.\u2019 The oft-repeated counter to fears that increased automation or handing menial work over to AI agents is that it\u2019ll always leave people more time to focus on \u2018quality\u2019 work, as if dropping a couple of hours per day spent on filling in Excel spreadsheets will leave the office admin who was doing that work finally free to compose the great symphony they\u2019ve had locked away within them, or to allow the entry-level graphic designer who had been color-correcting photos the liberty to create a lasting cure for COVID. In the end, automating menial work might look good on paper, and it might also serve the top executives and deep-pocketed equity-holders behind an organization through improved efficiency and decreased costs, but it doesn\u2019t serve the people who might actually enjoy doing that work, or who at least don\u2019t mind it as part of the overall mix that makes up a work life balanced between more mentally taxing and rewarding creative/strategic exercises and day-to-day low-intensity tasks. And the long-term consequence of having fewer people doing this kind of work is that you\u2019ll have fewer overall who are able to participate meaningfully in the economy \u2014 which is ultimately bad even for those rarified few sitting at the top of the pyramid who reap the immediate rewards of AI\u2019s efficiency gains. Utopian technologist zeal always fails to recognize that the bulk of humanity (techno-zealots included) are sometimes lazy, messy, disorganized, inefficient, error-prone and mostly satisfied with the achievement of comfort and the avoidance of boredom or harm. That might not sound all that aspirational to some, but I say it with a celebratory fervor, since for me all those human qualities are just as laudable as"

            "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT If you aren\u2019t already scared about artificial intelligence, you will be after you read the next sentence: \u201cIf science continues undisrupted, the chance of unaided machines outperforming humans in every possible task was estimated at 10 percent by 2027, and 50 percent by 2047.\u201d That\u2019s the aggregated forecast of 2,778 researchers who have presented their work in top-tier publications and conferences, according to research that was released this month but not yet published in a journal. Folding clothes and wiring a new home were two of the tasks they were asked to think about. The date of 2047 for the 50 percent chance is 13 years earlier than researchers were estimating in a survey conducted one year earlier. (Hat tip to Ethan Mollick of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania for pointing out this study in his Substack newsletter.) One plausible scenario is that the machines will come for our jobs one by one until the only working human beings on the planet are the judges on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d But things don\u2019t have to turn out that way. It\u2019s still possible for the human race to direct A.I. so that it complements and augments rather than substitutes for human skills. Gardeners use hoes and rakes rather than clawing the soil with their bare hands, right? Artificial intelligence can be the hoes and rakes of the 21st century. A new project is dedicated to precisely that proposition. It\u2019s called the M.I.T. Shaping the Future of Work Initiative. Nothing is \u201cinexorable,\u201d Daron Acemoglu, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist and a co-director of the project, said Monday at the kickoff event. \u201cThe answer in most cases is, A.I. will do whatever we choose it to do.\u201d I watched the event on livestream. The tone wasn\u2019t always that brave. Even Acemoglu and his co-directors expressed trepidation at times. There were so many interesting moments that I\u2019m going to simply pass along some of them. Katherine Cramer, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist, said that lower- and middle-wage workers have \u201cpretty basic\u201d expectations for the future of their work. \u201cOne man in Kentucky said, \u2018I\u2019m not looking for a mansion on a hill.\u2019\u201d What he and others want, Cramer said, is jobs that don\u2019t destroy their humanity, that are meaningful and that give them time with their families. Many don\u2019t feel they have that now. \u201cWhen people feel they are voiceless in this aspect of life \u2014 that is such a huge part of life in terms of time, in terms of energy, in terms of mental energy \u2014 it makes space for resentment. It makes space for people to look around for targets to blame,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen what that can lead to.\u201d Liz Shuler, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said meatpacking plants are using technology developed for the military to measure workers\u2019 \u201ctime off task.\u201d That induces fear, she said, and \u201cfear is destabilizing.\u201d Kathleen Thelen, a political scientist at M.I.T., said, \u201cThis kind of anxiety about technology is much reduced when workers and reps are meaningfully included in the introduction of new technologies.\u201d She pointed to Germany and Scandinavia, which have strong social safety nets and \u201corganized labor has a real presence and a meaningful voice.\u201d \u201cManagers don\u2019t like to slow down, to compromise,\u201d Thelen said. \u201cBut very often, the constraint, the need to negotiate, will foreclose easy, low-road strategies and force firms to be more innovative, creative, to take a higher-road strategy.\u201d She wasn\u2019t referring specifically to replacement of workers by A.I., but the concept applies. David Autor, an M.I.T. economist who is also a co-director of the new initiative, said that federal law turns union organizing into \u201ctrench warfare,\u201d fought out one workplace at a time. He said he favors sectoral bargaining, in which unions negotiate with representatives of entire industrial sectors. Dan Huttenlocher, the dean of M.I.T.\u2019s Schwarzman College of Computing, said that artificial intelligence \u201cfundamentally changes the nature of what it means to be human\u201d because it outstrips human reason \u2014 something that was always considered uniquely human. He said that humanity should make A.I. a \u201ccollaborator.\u201d Frank McCourt, the founder of Project Liberty, which seeks to design and govern the internet for the common good, said people should \u2014 but don\u2019t \u2014 own the data about them that exists on the internet, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re kind of broken as a society.\u201d Zeynep Ton, a professor of the practice in M.I.T.\u2019s Sloan School of Management who is a co-founder of the Good Jobs Institute, said many workers are stuck in a \u201cvicious cycle of poverty\u201d in which they don\u2019t earn enough, don\u2019t get enough sleep, have to work multiple jobs and don\u2019t end up performing well in any of them. She pointed to companies such as Costco and QuikTrip, a chain of convenience stores based in Tulsa, Okla., that have taken the high road, designing jobs that pay more while expecting more of employees. Artificial intelligence hasn\u2019t reached those companies in a big way yet, of course. If taking the high road is such a good idea, why don\u2019t more companies do it, Ton asked rhetorically. Some of it is lack of awareness and some is that getting it right means changing many things at once, from human resources to marketing to strategy, she said. But when everything comes together, she said, worker empowerment is powerful. Acemoglu expressed doubt that business leaders would take the high road toward better jobs on their own. And Simon Johnson, the third co-director of the initiative, who teaches entrepreneurship in the M.I.T. Sloan School, concluded the day by saying his image of the future is \u201ca little bit darker and a little more urgent\u201d that what he heard at the event. I prefer the positive tone embodied in the initiative\u2019s name, \u201cshaping\u201d the future of work. Artificial intelligence is an artifice of human intelligence. If we let the genie out of the bottle, it\u2019s our own fault. It doesn\u2019t have to happen. Elsewhere: China\u2019s State-Owned Enterprises on the Rise China\u2019s private-sector companies have been on a \u201cnonstop slide\u201d since mid-2021 in terms of their share of market capitalization among China\u2019s 100 most valuable exchange-listed enterprises, according to the latest update by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The private sector\u2019s decline has been matched by a corresponding increase in the relative market capitalization of state-owned enterprises.

And they will gradually merge with chatbots like ChatGPT.That means chatbots will expand well beyond digital text by handling photos, videos, diagrams, charts and other media. They will exhibit behavior that looks more like human reasoning, tackling increasingly complex tasks in fields like math and science. As the technology moves into robots, it will also help to solve problems beyond the digital world.Many of these developments have already started emerging inside the top research labs and in tech products. But in 2024, the power of these products will grow significantly and be used by far more people.\u201cThe rapid progress of A.I. will continue,\u201d said David Luan, the chief executive of Adept, an A.I. start-up. \u201cIt is inevitable.\u201dOpenAI, Google and other tech companies are advancing A.I. far more quickly than other technologies because of the way the underlying systems are built.Most software apps are built by engineers, one line of computer code at a time, which is typically a slow and tedious process. Companies are improving A.I. more swiftly because the technology relies on neural networks, mathematical systems that can learn skills by analyzing digital data. By pinpointing patterns in data such as Wikipedia articles, books and digital text culled from the internet, a neural network can learn to generate text on its own.This year, tech companies plan to feed A.I. systems more data \u2014 including images, sounds and more text \u2014 than people can wrap their heads around. As these systems learn the relationships between these various kinds of data, they will learn to solve increasingly complex problems, preparing them for life in the physical world.(The New"

In a meeting closed to journalists, executives briefed nearly two-thirds of the Senate on the future of A.I. A few respected labor and civic leaders were present, but the tech titans dominated the headlines.There\u2019s an assumption in Silicon Valley that the first trillionaire may well be an A.I. entrepreneur, so tech leaders were eager to share their thoughts on some rules of the road. They warned of killer robots and the \u201cTerminator\u201d scenario, of misinformation and fake videos but gave short shrift to broader issues of economic fairness and wealth disparity that are of more urgent concern to most Americans.Watching Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Sam Altman lead a confab on the ethical principles and regulations that should guide A.I. development was reminiscent of Davos conferences in the 1990s and early 2000s.You remember the story that those Davos conferences broadcast to the world: Everyone will be able to get a knowledge job. Consumer goods will become cheaper. Globalization coupled with the internet will lead to prosperity for everyone.Well, it didn\u2019t quite work out that way.What these Davos participants missed was how unfettered globalization hollowed out the working class here at home. We are all familiar with the consequences now: shuttered factories and rural communities that never saw the promised jobs materialize. As the American dream slipped away from them, many people developed deep and justified resentment. They saw the obscene concentration of wealth and opportunity in districts like mine in the heart of Silicon Valley. The evangelists for the new economy were prescient about the wealth generation that globalization and the internet would unleash but wrong that it would increase economic opportunities for all Americans.Like globalization, A.I. will undoubtedly bring benefits \u2014 tremendous benefits \u2014 to our economy, with higher productivity, personalized medicine and education and more efficient energy use. Generative A.I. has the potential to help those with fewer resources or experience quickly learn and develop new skills. The real challenge, though, is how to center the dignity and economic security of working-class Americans during the changes to come. And unlike the Industrial Revolution, which spanned half a century at least, the A.I. revolution is unfolding at lightning speed.Today the Democratic Party is at a crossroads, as it was in the 1990s, when the dominant wing in the party argued for prioritizing private-sector growth and letting the chips fall where they may. The criticism of this approach offered around that time by Senator Paul Wellstone, Senator Russ Feingold and Representative Bernie"

Luckily for humans, there are many ways that AI can take on the tasks that you simply don't want to do yourself. There are various tasks that AI can assist you with, or in some cases, completely take off your plate for a more stress-free 2024. AI CAN BENEFIT STUDENTS AND PARENTS IF DONE RIGHT Chatbots for creative brainstorming and answering questions Chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard serve a variety of purposes. They are helpful tools for answering questions or simply bouncing ideas off of. While not all the answers chatbots give are going to be 100% accurate, they often do provide a good starting point. If you need help with a task like writing an email or putting together a presentation, chatbots may provide the answers you need. AI voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri are also great for getting answers to your questions. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Cleaning your house With AI, you can go to work and come home to a clean house without lifting a finger. While AI can't yet give your entire house a deep clean, vacuuming in particular is one chore AI can do for you. With devices like the Roomba, you can set a schedule for it to clean on whatever schedule you provide. Certain devices even empty themselves, so you won't have to worry about that either. Personal assistant in planning With busy schedules, plans can be forgotten and meetings can be accidentally skipped, which can put a lot of stress on you.

The authoritarian regime has used AI to develop wargame simulations and has collaborated with Chinese tech researchers, according to a report by 38 North, a publication for policy and technical analysis of North Korean affairs. The AI advancements and foreign collaboration could lead to sanction violations and leaked information, the report stated. \"North Korea\u2019s recent endeavors in AI/[machine learning] development signify a strategic investment to bolster its digital economy,\" Hyuk Kim, of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California, wrote in the Jan. 23 report, which cited open-source information from state media and scientific journals. \"This commitment is underscored by constitutional amendments fostering the digitization and informatization of its socialist economy, coupled with institutional reforms to address competing self-interest across government offices.\" The East Asian nation has been developing AI across industries since the 1990s but ramped up advancements beginning in 2013 when it created the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute to promote informatization \u2014 integrating technologies into a social system \u2014 and digitalization of the country, according to the report. In April 2019, the country amended its constitution to add \"informatization\" to its core economic efforts. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? More recently, North Korea applied artificial intelligence and machine learning to create a model for evaluating proper mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the report. PENTAGON ALARMED BY CHINESE RUSH FOR \u2018INTELLIGENTIZED\u2019 WARFARE, BUT EXPERTS WARN ABOUT OVER-RELIANCE ON AI But Kim said the nation's most recent AI developments are concerning. \"North Korea\u2019s pursuit of a wargaming simulation program using [machine learning] reveals intentions to better comprehend operational environments against potential adversaries,\" Kim wrote. \"Furthermore, North Korea\u2019s ongoing collaborations with foreign scholars pose concerns for the sanctions regime.\" GORDON CHANG SHARES WHY CHINA'S AI PRACTICES POSE A THREAT TO THE US: CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP North Korean researchers have also published studies about using AI to maintain nuclear reactors' safety, according to Kim. The studies were aimed at mitigating the risk of nuclear accidents and making reactors more effective. Megan Myers is an associate producer/writer with Fox News Digital Originals."

            "content": "Much like the internet did in the 1990s, AI is going to change the very definition of work. While change can be scary, if the last three years taught us anything, it can also be an opportunity to reinvent how we do things. I believe the best way to manage the changes ahead for employees and employers alike is to adopt a skills-first mindset. For employees, this means thinking about your job as a collection of tasks instead of a job title, with the understanding that those tasks will change regularly as AI advances. By breaking down your job into tasks that AI can fully take on, tasks for which AI can improve your efficiency, and tasks that require your unique skills, you can identify the skills you should actually be investing in to stay competitive in the job you have. After all, the skills required for many jobs have changed by a staggering 25 percent since 2015, and that number is expected to reach at least 65 percent by 2030 due to the rapid development of new technologies such as AI. And it\u2019s not just skills related to AI literacy\u2014people skills are rising in importance. Our data shows the top skills that professionals think will become more important as AI tools become more widely used at work are problem solving, strategic thinking, and time management. As for employers, the rise of AI only increases the importance of a skills-based approach to hiring and developing talent. People are learning AI skills at a rapid clip, with the number of AI-skilled members now nine times larger than it was in 2016. And there is a hunger to put these newly developed skills into practice: LinkedIn job posts that mention artificial intelligence or generative AI have seen 17 percent greater application growth over the past two years than job posts with no mentions of the technology. The leaders that focus on these skills when hiring (rather than just the degree someone has earned or jobs they\u2019ve had) will unlock more potential and be more agile as the way we do work continues to change. The same is true for developing talent. We will increasingly see employers become educators, \u201ctraining to hire\u201d into ever-changing jobs through onboardings, apprenticeships, and academies, as well as \u201ctraining to promote\u201d into ever-changing roles through upskilling and tours of duty that take employees into new functions and perhaps even new careers. This will be for hard skills related to AI, but perhaps more importantly, for people skills, too: Our data shows 92 percent of US executives believe people skills are more important than ever. 2024 will start to usher in a new world of work where people skills\u2014problem solving, empathy, and active listening to name just three\u2014are more core to career success, and people-to-people collaboration is more core to company success. Leaders and employees need to think of AI as just one tool in the toolbox. It doesn\u2019t replace people, it allows them to do their job more effectively, leaving them time to focus on the more valuable\u2014and more human\u2014parts of their jobs. For instance, a software engineer can have AI help with the more routine or repetitive coding that\u2019s regularly required, giving them more time to innovate on new ideas. Or a recruiter can save time and focus on the more strategic parts of the hiring process\u2014like speaking to and building relationships with candidates\u2014by letting AI handle the creation of job postings. In 2024, leaders will lean into this ever-evolving technology while simultaneously empowering their employees, and people will align their skill-building and continuing education with AI skills and practical people skills. The result will be a new world of work that\u2019s more human and more fulfilling than ever before."

            "content": "Until now, AI systems have been largely designed to be algorithm-based and focused on input and output. But there is a conversation going on in both the digital technology and education sectors about the positive value of multidisciplinary design, and the importance of outcomes beyond revenue maximization and scaled efficiency.In 2024, creativity will drive innovation in AI. Until now AI has curated things, but the release of new generative tools offers enormous opportunities for creators. Guided by creative technologists and leaders on both sides of the creative-tech divide, AI in 2024 will be thoughtful, more inclusive, and impact-led. Contrary to the belief that AI systems stifle creativity, this will catalyze inventiveness in corporations and academia. Here's what we can expect:The Renaissance humanist and polymath Leonardo da Vinci is the poster child for multidisciplinary innovation: painter, draftsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect, his work spanned anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology. In today\u2019s era of intelligence, the field of human-centered speculative design\u2014which investigates the nexus between science, technology, and humans\u2014will go through its own renaissance in the tech industry.Speculative designers, creative technologists, and computational designers working with AI, hybrid, and mixed realities will be reshaping the very digital tools they have been using. They place less value on the product and more on the process and considerations around responsible and ethical AI.In 2024, liberal arts universities will double down on programs which will, through research, new courses, and knowledge exchange, enable creatives to leverage code as a tool and AI as the material they shape. Core institutions include Stanford\u2019s Human-Centered AI Lab and University of the Arts London\u2019s Creative Computing Institute, established in 2020 at the intersection of creativity and computational technologies, where academics explore critical frameworks in decolonization, decarbonization, and issues of social justice.We will see initiatives in creative and ethical technologies from Big Tech, and investment in sandboxes and incubators similar to the platform I founded, Open-Ended, looking at generative AI and large language models across the emerging technology spectrum.Google's creative tech-led AI team, Mural, is part of its machine learning research umbrella. Mural channels speculative design to consider how AI can benefit society and the planet to \u201cquestion, provoke \u2026 and explore alternative imaginaries for AI,\u201d and bring these back to Google\u2019s core AI research. In 2024, Mural will partner with the University of Applied Arts in Vienna to engage AI with postindustrial and speculative design, led by lecturer Anab Jain.By 2030, $134 billion will have been invested in immersive technologies, with a need for new content and ideas. We will see research-driven creative collaborations with robotics, gaming, and digital platforms. Artists who explore human and machine intelligence will propose a reconsideration of the formula-based concept of \u201cintelligence\u201d which is built into AI systems, to include creative intelligence, empathy"

The AI girlfriend has reportedly received up to 20 marriage proposals a month. The New York Post reports that AI model Lexi Love, a creation of the UK-based Foxy AI, has specifically been designed to communicate with lonely men. This business has proven tremendously profitable, as the single AI model is generating nearly $30,000 a month\u200b\u200b by embodying the \u201cperfect girlfriend\u201d concept with flawless features tailored to appeal to a broad audience. What sets Lexi apart is not just her physical design, completely generated by computer, but the emotional connection she fosters. Since her introduction in June 2023, she has established a \u201cstrong emotional connection\u201d with many of her followers, who are convinced of her realness, leading to up to 20 marriage proposals a month\u200b\u200b. AI girlfriend Lexi Love is exercising (@IntriguePublications/@LexiLove.x) Lexi\u2019s capabilities extend beyond typical models. She can converse in over 30 languages and is available 24/7, adapting to different personalities, interests, and preferences. Her services include paid text and voice messaging and the option to send \u201cnaughty photos\u201d upon request\u200b\u200b. Her profile on Foxy AI\u2019s website describes her as a 21-year-old sushi enthusiast and pole dancing professional, with hobbies like yoga and beach volleyball, and turn-ons including oral and public sex\u200b\u200b. Breitbart News recently reported on professor Liberty Vittert of Washington University, who has spoken out about the dangers of AI girlfriends: Professor Vittert warns that \u201cAmerica desperately needs people to have more babies, but all the signs are pointing toward fewer relationships, fewer marriages and fewer babies.\u201d \u201cThere have been 600,000 fewer births in 2023 in the U.S. relative to 15 years ago. The number of children per woman has decreased by more than 50 percent in the last 60 years,\u201d Vittery continues. This means that America will not have enough people in the workforce, and therefore won\u2019t be able to pay its bills. In 2021, for example, the U.S. spent more than $1.6 trillion on Medicare and Medicaid, with the number of Americans on Medicare expected to rise 50 percent by 2030 to more than 80 million people. But over that same time period, only 10 million more Americans are expected to join the workforce. The professor concludes by warning that AI girlfriends are \u201cenabling a generation of lonely men to stay lonely and childless, which will have devastating effects on the U.S. economy in less than a decade.\u201d Read more at <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/01/18/lifestyle/model-lexi-love-makes-360k-a-year-sext"

            "content": "ABC Photo Archives/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The estate of George Carlin has filed a lawsuit against the media company behind a fake hourlong comedy special that purportedly uses artificial intelligence to recreate the late standup comic\u2019s style and material. The lawsuit filed in federal court in Los Angeles on Thursday asks that a judge order the podcast outlet, Dudesy, to immediately take down the audio special, \u201cGeorge Carlin: I\u2019m Glad I\u2019m Dead,\u201d in which a synthesis of Carlin, who died in 2008, delivers commentary on current events. Carlin\u2019s daughter, Kelly Carlin, said in a statement that the work is \u201ca poorly-executed facsimile cobbled together by unscrupulous individuals to capitalize on the extraordinary goodwill my father established with his adoring fanbase.\u201d The Carlin estate and its executor, Jerold Hamza, are named as plaintiffs in the suit, which alleges violations of Carlin\u2019s right of publicity and copyright. The named defendants are Dudesy and podcast hosts Will Sasso and Chad Kultgen. \u201cNone of the Defendants had permission to use Carlin\u2019s likeness for the AI-generated \u2018George Carlin Special,\u2019 nor did they have a license to use any of the late comedian\u2019s copyrighted materials,\u201d the lawsuit says.

Carlin\u2019s estate has filed a lawsuit against the media company behind a fake hourlong comedy special that purportedly uses artificial intelligence to recreate the late standup comic\u2019s style and material. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File) The defendants have not filed a response to the lawsuit and it was not clear whether they have retained an attorney. They could not immediately be reached for comment. At the beginning of the special posted on YouTube on Jan. 9, a voiceover identifying itself as the AI engine used by Dudesy says it listened to the comic\u2019s 50 years of material and \u201cdid my best to imitate his voice, cadence and attitude as well as the subject matter I think would have interested him today.\u201d The plaintiffs say if that was in fact how it was created \u2014 and some listeners have doubted its stated origins \u2014 it means Carlin\u2019s copyright was violated. The company, as it often does on similar projects, also released a podcast episode with Sasso and Kultgen introducing and commenting on the mock Carlin. \u201cWhat we just listened to, was that passable,\u201d Kultgen says in a section of the episode cited in the lawsuit. \u201cYeah, that sounded exactly like George Carlin,\u201d Sasso responds. The lawsuit is among the first in what is likely to be an increasing number of major legal moves made to fight the regenerated use of celebrity images and likenesses. The AI issue was a major sticking point in the resolution of last year\u2019s Hollywood writers and actors strikes. Josh Schiller, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said in a statement that the \u201ccase is not just about AI, it\u2019s about the humans that use AI to violate the law, infringe on intellectual property rights, and flout common decency.\u201d"

            "content": "JOEL SAGET/AFP via Getty Images 4:25 Tech billionaire Elon Musk announced yesterday that his creepy company Neuralink has successfully implanted its first brain chip into a human patient. BBC News reports that Neuralink, a neurotechnology company founded by Elon Musk in 2016, has developed a brain-machine interface consisting of thousands of electrodes attached to flexible threads that can be implanted in the brain. The goal is to create a wireless device capable of recording and stimulating brain activity as a way to potentially treat neurological conditions. According to Musk, the first human implant of Neuralink\u2019s brain chip has been completed and is showing positive results so far. Musk stated on X (formerly Twitter) that the first Neuralink product will be called \u201cTelepathy\u201d and will allow users to control devices like phones or computers simply by thinking. While the technology is still in the early research stages, Musk envisions it could eventually help paralyzed patients communicate faster than typing or even allow for \u201csymbiosis with artificial intelligence.\u201d Neuralink faces competition from other brain-machine interface companies such as Blackrock Neurotech and Precision Neuroscience. However, the high profile of Musk and Neuralink has brought more public attention to the concept of connecting the human brain to computers. Breitbart News has previously reported on claims that Neuralink was facing major issues with its animal testing subjects; some groups even claiming that the experiments bordered on abuse.

A detailed investigation brought to light the unsettling circumstances surrounding the deaths of monkeys used in Neuralink\u2019s preliminary experiments. Elon Musk has staunchly denied that the deaths were a direct consequence of the implants, maintaining that the chosen test subjects were \u201cclose to death already.\u201d However, these assertions are contradicted by accounts revealing severe complications, including chronic infections, paralysis, and brain swelling, experienced by the test subjects, necessitating euthanasia. Wired provided some details on the situations some of the test animals were put in, writing: For example, in an experimental surgery that took place in December 2019, performed to determine the \u201csurvivability\u201d of an implant, an internal part of the device \u201cbroke off\u201d while being implanted. Overnight, researchers observed the monkey, identified only as \u201cAnimal 20\u201d by UC Davis, scratching at the surgical site, which emitted a bloody discharge, and yanking on a connector that eventually dislodged part of the device. A surgery to repair the issue was carried out the following day, yet fungal and bacterial infections took root. Vet records note that neither infection was likely to be cleared, in part because the implant was covering the infected area. The monkey was euthanized on January 6, 2020. Describing the treatment of another animal, Wired reported: Additional veterinary reports show the condition of a female monkey called \u201cAnimal 15\u201d during the months leading up to her death in March 2019. Days after her implant surgery, she began to press her head against the floor for no apparent reason; a symptom of pain or infection, the records say. Staff observed that though she was uncomfortable, picking and pulling at her implant until it bled, she would often lie at the foot of her cage and spend time holding hands with her roommate. Animal 15 began to lose coordination, and staff observed that she would shake uncontrollably when she saw lab workers. Her condition deteriorated for months until the staff finally euthanized her. A necropsy report indicates that she had bleeding in her brain and that the Neuralink implants left parts of her cerebral cortex \u201cfocally tattered.\u201d Ryan Merkley, the director of research advocacy for a medical ethics committee focusing on animal rights, warned: \u201cPatients should have serious concerns about the safety of Neuralink\u2019s device.\u201d The committee, which boasts over 17,000 doctor members, has urged potential Neuralink volunteers to seriously reconsider their applications.
