            "content": "The informal TechCrunch book club is now venturing into the short story \u201cExhalation,\u201d the second piece in Ted Chiang\u2019s eponymous collection. Today\u2019s story gets at the meaning of existence, climate change, community and connection all within a beautifully intricate story that runs for just a few handfuls of pages. I was hooked, and so let\u2019s talk about some of the messages Chiang wants to send as part of the piece. Some quick notes: Want to join the conversation? Feel free to email me your thoughts at bookclub@techcrunch.com or join some of the discussions on Reddit or Twitter (hashtag: #TCBookClub) Follow these informal book club articles here: https://techcrunch.com/book-review/. That page also has a built-in RSS feed for posts exclusively in the Book Review category, which is very low volume. Feel free to add your comments in our TechCrunch comments section below this post. Thoughts on \u201cExhalation\u201d Chiang has constructed a magnificent story around the most basic and forgettable of substances: air. He starts the story with what otherwise appears to be a normal day in the life of an everyday human, but within a few paragraphs, we learn that the narrator is \u201cgoing to the filling stations\u201d and it slowly dawns on us that the narrator \u2014 and all the people that populate this imaginative world \u2014 are actually some form of cybernetic beings, dependent on a mechanical supply of air for their machined bodies. We learn that these filling stations, where people pick up their air supply, aren\u2019t just refueling utilities, but are key community outposts where connections are formed between people. \u201cFor the filling stations are the primary venue for social conversation, the places from which we draw emotional sustenance as well as physical.\u201d But that\u2019s not all, Chiang writes. \u201c\u2026 there is camaraderie derived from the awareness that all our air comes from the same source\u2026\u201d As we learn as the story progresses, air isn\u2019t just present in this universe \u2014 it is fundamentally the connective substance not only between every individual, but also the past and the future. Memories held in the brains of these individuals aren\u2019t inscribed, but are rather reconfigured as air passes through them. Therefore, what is memorable \u2014 what is most visible \u2014 is ultimately a function of what is not even seen. The narrator describes this discovery as he investigates his own brain in an experiment: Watching the oscillations of these flakes of gold, I saw that air does not, as we had always assumed, simply provide power to the engine that realizes our thoughts. Air is in fact the very medium of our thoughts. All that we are is a pattern of air flow. What\u2019s incredible about this story is that Chiang pushes this metaphor another layer deeper. The narrator learns that the world relies on the pressure difference between the air in the atmosphere and the air in each individual\u2019s body, and that this difference is decreasing. Suddenly, the fate of the entire universe has become clear: There may well be air everywhere, but it\u2019s the differential that matters, and that differential is slowly receding with every breath, every twitch of a limb and stray thought. Equilibrium \u2014 and therefore death \u2014 is just around the corner. Gloriously, Chiang describes the dawn of time: The universe began as an enormous breath being held. Who knows why, but whatever the reason, I am glad that it did, because I owe my existence to that fact. All my desires and ruminations are no more and no less than eddy currents generated by the gradual exhalation of our universe. And until this great exhalation is finished, my thoughts live on. This is an ambitious leap and one that springs beautifully from the page. We have gone from air as individual sustenance, to air as community resource and connective tissue, to air as the very meaning of existence, tied into a fate where we already know how the final chapter will be written. Here is the substance we never think about, and instead of being nothing it is actually everything we care about. There is a parallel here of course to our own world. In much the way the everyday actions of the individuals in this short story deplete the pressure difference of their world and ultimately make it uninhabitable, there is clearly a connection to our own present crisis regarding climate change. How should we handle the fatalism of those climate trendlines that show Earth eventually dying off sometime in the future? The story doesn\u2019t try to minimize that fatalism. In fact, it actively diminishes the idea that there are technical solutions to these problems. Our narrator describes a sect known as the \u201cReversalists,\u201d who attempt to build a machine that can increase the difference in air pressure in the universe. But our narrator isn\u2019t optimistic, and essentially argues that such a machine is impossible to design. Instead, the story exhorts us to revel in the limited time we have in this universe, even knowing that the world is going to come to an inevitable end. \u201cBecause even if a universe\u2019s life span is calculable, the variety of life that is generated within it is not.\u201d Rather than spending our limited time trying to push back the end (of the universe or of our own demise), we should instead ignore that fatal ending and focus on the present, and the wonders that we get to experience while the world is alive for us. I can go on and on about air here, and indeed, multiple re-readings of this chapter have revealed new connections and symbols that are absolutely fascinating. But I want to move on to two other points that I think this short story wants to tell. In the story, our narrator is an anatomist, who learns about a strange set of facts \u2014 that clocks appear to be changing speed in multiple districts in this universe. They learn about these facts, but unlike anyone else, they seem willing to ask more fundamental and deeper questions about why basic mechanics of the universe aren\u2019t what they seem: Most people suspected fraud, a practical joke perpetrated by mischief-makers. I had a different suspicion, a darker one that I dared not voice, but it decided my course of action; I would proceed with my experiment. Our narrator explains that there is a reigning theory about the workings of the brain called the inscription hypothesis, which they reject. By the end of the story though, we see how our narrator\u2019s experiment of opening their own brain and investigating its workings eventually overturned that hypothesis. It\u2019s not only a commentary on the scientific method, but I also feel that there is a point here about asking even the hardest questions about the data that we are seeing in our universe. We talk about this all the time in the startup world, but here we have in clear relief a person who didn\u2019t just accept the prevailing theory of how something worked, or ignored the facts and data from their universe, or avoided approaching the hardest questions they stumbled upon. Instead, they confronted them, and also did so individually, without the consent or approval of others. That\u2019s a reminder that sometimes, when we are on the frontiers of science, that the hardest questions sometimes can\u2019t be answered in collaboration with others \u2014 that the air that connects us breaks down here. The other symbol I loved here is around the \u201cexperiment\u201d itself. Our narrator builds a machine that allows them to dissect their own brain, and in the process allows them to see the true meaning of the universe. Chiang spends a sizable part of the story building up the dissection, going through with it and discussing its implications, and it isn\u2019t hard to see why. The brain dissection is a beautiful metaphor for literally \u201copening our minds\u201d to new experiences and ideas. Our narrator carefully prepares to open their mind, splaying their brain out in a painstaking and careful order to understand its inner workings. As they do this though, they discover who they really are, and also the fate of the universe along the way. It\u2019s a gorgeous symbol, and like so much of this story, a layered opinion about what it means to be an individual and how we relate to each other. As Chiang closes out, \u201cContemplate the marvel that is existence, and rejoice that you are able to do so. I feel I have the right to tell you this because, as I am inscribing these words, I am doing the same.\u201d Some questions for \u201cWhat\u2019s Expected of Us\u201d Next week, we will read the ultra-short story (four pages!), the third part of \u201cExhalation\u201d the collection. It\u2019s an interesting meditation on free will versus destiny, and asks a lot of questions in a taut story. Have comments on what you read? Send them to me at bookclub@techcrunch.com"

            "content": "The interesting thing about the technology business is that, most of the time, it\u2019s not the technology that matters. What matters is how people react to it, and what new social norms they form. This is especially true in today\u2019s era, well past the midpoint of the deployment age of smartphones and the internet. People \u2014 smart, thoughtful people, with relevant backgrounds and domain knowledge \u2014 thought that Airbnb and Uber were doomed to failure, because obviously no one would want to stay in a stranger\u2019s home or ride in a stranger\u2019s car. People thought the iPhone would flop, because users would \u201cdetest the touch screen interface.\u201d People thought enterprise software-as-a-service would never fly, because executives would insist on keeping servers in-house at all costs. These people were so, so, so wrong; but note that they weren\u2019t wrong about the technology. (Nobody really argued about the technology.) Instead they were dead wrong about other people, and how their own society and culture would respond to this new stimulus. They were anthropologically incorrect. This, of course, is why every major VC firm, and every large tech company, keeps a crack team of elite anthropologists busy at all times, with big budgets and carte blanche, reporting directly to the leadership team, right? (Looks around.) Oh. Instead they\u2019re doing focus groups and user interviews, asking people in deeply artificial settings to project their usage of an alien technology in an unknown context, and calling that their anthropological, I\u2019m sorry, their market research? Oh. I kid, I kid. Sort of, at least, in that I\u2019m not sure a crack team of elite anthropologists would be all that much more effective. It\u2019s hard enough getting an accurate answer of how a person would use a new technology when that\u2019s the only variable. When they live in a constantly shifting and evolving world of other new technologies, when the ones which take root and spread have a positive-feedback-loop effect on the culture and mindset toward new technologies, and when every one of your first 20 interactions with new tech changes your feelings about it \u2026 it\u2019s basically impossible. And so: painful trial and error, on all sides. Uber and Lyft didn\u2019t think people would happily ride in strangers\u2019 cars either; that\u2019s why Uber started as what is now Uber Black, basically limos-via-app, and Lyft used to have that painfully cringeworthy \u201cride in the front seat, fist-bump your driver\u201d policy. Those are the success stories. The graveyard of companies whose anthropological guesses were too wrong to pivot to rightness, or who couldn\u2019t / wouldn\u2019t do so fast enough, is full to bursting with tombstones. That\u2019s why VCs and Y Combinator have been much more secure businesses than startups; they get to run dozens or hundreds of anthropological experiments in parallel, while startups get to run one, maybe two, three if they\u2019re really fast and flexible, and then they die. This applies to enterprise businesses too, of course. Zoom was an anthropological bet that corporate cultures would make video conferencing big and successful if it actually worked. It\u2019s easy to imagine the mood among CEOs instead being \u201cwe need in-person meetings to encourage those Moments of Serendipity,\u201d which you\u2019ll notice is the same argument that biased so many big companies against remote work and in favor of huge corporate campuses \u2026 an attitude that looks quaint, old-fashioned and outmoded, now. This doesn\u2019t just apply to the deployment phase of technologies. The irruption phase has its own anthropology. But irruption affects smaller sectors of the economy, whose participants are mostly technologists themselves, so it\u2019s more anthropologically reasonable for techies to extrapolate from their own views and project how that society will change. The meta-anthropological theory held by many is that what the highly technical do today, the less technical will do tomorrow. That\u2019s a belief held throughout the tiny, wildly non-representative cryptocurrency community, for instance. But even if it was true once, is it still? Or is a shift away from that pattern to another, larger social change? I don\u2019t know, but I can tell you how we\u2019re going to find out: painful trial and error."

            "content": "During this week\u2019s Democratic debate, there was a lot of talk, unsurprisingly, about ensuring the future of this country\u2019s children and grandchildren. Climate change was of particular interest to billionaire Tom Steyer, who said repeatedly that addressing it would be his top priority were he elected U.S. president. As it happens, earlier the same day, we\u2019d spent time on the phone with two venture capitalists who think of almost nothing else every day. The reason: they both invest in so-called deep tech, and they meet routinely with startups whose central focus is on making the world habitable for generations of people to come \u2014 as well as trying to produce outsize financial returns, of course. The two VCs with whom we talked know each other well. Siraj Khaliq is a partner at the global venture firm Atomico, where he tries to find world-changing startups that are enabled by machine learning, AI, and computer vision. He has strong experience in the area, having cofounded The Climate Corporation back in 2006, a company that helps farmers optimize crop yield and that was acquired by Monsanto in 2013 for roughly $1 billion. Seth Bannon is meanwhile a founding partner of Fifty Years, a nearly five-year-old, San Francisco-based seed-stage fund whose stated ambition is backing founders who want to solve the world\u2019s biggest problems. The investors\u2019 interests overlap so much that Khaliq is also one of Fifty Years\u2019s investors. From both, we wanted to know which companies or trends are capturing their imagination and, in some cases, their investment dollars. Following are excerpts from our extended conversation earlier this week. (We thought it was interesting; hopefully you will, too.) TC: Seth, how would you describe what you\u2019re looking to fund at your firm? SB: There\u2019s a Winston Churchill essay [penned nearly 100 years ago] called \u201cFifty Years Hence\u201d that describes what we do. He predicts genomic engineering, synthetic biology, growing meat without animals, nuclear power, satellite telephony. Churchill also notes that because tech changes so quickly that it\u2019s important that technologists take a principled approach to their work. [Inspired by him] we\u2019re backing founders who can make a ton of money while doing good and focusing on health, disease, the climate crisis . . . TC: What does that mean exactly? Are you investing in software? SB: We\u2019re not so enthusiastic about pure software because it\u2019s been so abstracted away that it\u2019s become a commodity. High school students can now build an app, which is great, but it also means that competitive pressures are very high. There are a thousand funds focused on software seed investing. Fortunately, you can now launch a synthetic biology startup with seed funding, and that wasn\u2019t possible 10 years ago. There are a lot of infrastructural advancements happening that makes [deep tech investing even with smaller checks] interesting. TC: Siraj, you also invest exclusively on frontier, or deep tech, at Atomico. What\u2019s your approach to funding startups? SK: We do Series A [deals] onward and don\u2019t do seed stage. We primarily focus on Europe. But there\u2019s lot of common thinking between us and Seth. As a fund, we\u2019re looking for big problems that change the world, sometimes at companies that won\u2019t necessarily be big in five years but if you look out 10 years could be necessary for humanity. So we\u2019re trying to anticipate all of these big trends and focus on three or four theses a year and talk as much as we can with academics and other experts to understand what\u2019s going on. Founders then know we have an informed view. Last year, we focused on synthetic biology, which is a becoming so broad a category that it\u2019s time to start subdividing it. We were also doing AI-based drug discovery and quantum computing and we started to spend some time on energy as well. We also [continued an earlier focus on ] the future of manufacturing and industry. We see a number of trends that make [the latter] attractive, especially in Europe where manufacturing hasn\u2019t yet been digitized. TC: Seth, you mentioned synthetic biology infrastructure. Can you elaborate on what you\u2019re seeing that\u2019s interesting on this front? SB: You\u2019ve maybe heard of directed evolution, technology that allows biologists to use the power of evolution to get microbes or other biological machines to do what they want them to do that would have been impossible before. [Editor\u2019s note: here, Bannon talks a bit about Frances Arnold, the Nobel Prize-winning chemist who was awarded the honor in 2018 for developing the technique.] So we\u2019re excited to back [related] startups. One, Solugen, enzymatically makes industrial chemicals [by combining genetically modified enzymes with organic compounds, like plant sugars]. Hydrogen peroxide is a $6 billion dollar industry, and it\u2019s currently made through a petroleum-based process in seven-football-field-long production plants that sometimes explode and kill people. TC: Is this then akin to Zymergen, which develops molecules in order to create unique specialty materials? SB: Zymergen mainly works as a kind of consultant to help companies engineer strains that they want. Solugen is a vertically integrated chemicals company, so it [creates its formulations], then sells directly into industry. TC: How does this relate to new architectures? SB: The way to think about it is that there\u2019s a bunch of application-level companies, but as synthetic biology companies start to take off, there\u2019s a bunch of emerging infrastructure layer companies. One of these is Ansa Biotechnologies, which has a fully enzymatic process for writing DNA. Like Twist, which went public, they make DNA to sell to customers in the biotech industry. But whereas Twist is using a chemical process to make DNA, Ansa\u2019s approach is fully enzymatic. [Editor\u2019s note: More on the competition in this emerging space here.] Also, if you look at plant-based alternatives to meat, they\u2019re more sustainable but also far more expensive than traditional beef. Why is that? Well plant-based chicken is more expensive because the processing infrastructure being used is more than 10 years behind real chicken processing, where you\u2019ll see robot arms that cut up chicken so efficiently that it looks like a Tesla factory. [Alternative meat] companies are basically using these extruders built in the \u201970s because the industry has been so small, and that\u2019s because there\u2019s been a lot of skepticism from the investment community in these companies. Or there was. The performance of Beyond Meat\u2019s IPO ended it. Now there\u2019s a rush of founders and dollars into that space, and whenever you have a space where the core infrastructure has been neglected, there\u2019s opportunity. A former mechanical engineer with Boeing has started a company, Rebellyous Foods, to basically build the AWS for the plant-based food industry, for example. She\u2019s using [the machines she\u2019s building] to sell plant-based chicken nuggets, [but that\u2019s the longer-term plan]. TC: Siraj, you say last year you started to spend time on energy. What\u2019s interesting to you as it relates to energy? SK: There\u2019s been some improvement in how we capture emissions, but [carbon emissions] are still very deleterious to our health and the planet\u2019s health, and there are a few areas to think about [to address the problem]. Helping people measure and control their consumption is one approach, but also we think about how to produce new energy, which is a shift we [meaning mankind] need to undertake. The challenge [in making that shift] is often [capital expenditures]. It\u2019s hard for venture investors to back companies that are [building nuclear reactors], which makes government grants the best choice for early innovation oftentimes. There is one company, Seaborg, that has figured out a clever reactor. It\u2019s not a portfolio company but it\u2019s [compelling]. SB: We also really like what Seaborg is doing. These [fourth generation] nuclear companies have a whole host of approaches that allow for smaller, safer reactors that you wouldn\u2019t mind having in your backyard. But Siraj put his finger on it: as an early-stage deep tech investor, we have to consider the capital plan of a company, and if it needs to raise billions of dollars, early investors will get really diluted, so early-stage venture just isn\u2019t the best fit. TC: There are other areas you like, though, because costs have fallen so much. SB: Yes. Satellite telephony used to be one of those areas. Some of the satellites in space right now cost $350 million [to launch] and took three to four years to build, which would be really hard for any early-stage investor to fund. But now, a new generation of companies is building satellites for one-tenth of the cost in months, not years. That\u2019s a game changer. They can iterate faster. They can build a better product. They don\u2019t have to raise equity to build and launch either; they can raise from a debt financier [from whom they can] borrow money and pay it back over time. That model isn\u2019t available to a company like Uber or Lyft, because those companies can\u2019t say, \u2018X is going to cost us Y dollars and it will pay back Z over time.\u2019 TC: What of concerns that all these cheap satellites are going to clog up the sky pretty quickly? SB: It\u2019s a real concern. Most [of today\u2019s satellites] are low earth satellites, and the closer to the earth they are, the brighter they are; they reflect the sun more, the more satellites we\u2019re seeing instead of stars. I do think it\u2019s incumbent on all of these companies to think about how they are contributing to the future of humanity. But when you connect the unconnected, educational outcomes improve, health improves, inequality decreases, and the stability of governments improves, so maybe the developed world needs to sacrifice a bit. I think that\u2019s a reasonable tradeoff. If on the other hand, we\u2019re putting up satellites to help people buy more crap . . . TC: It\u2019s like the argument for self-driving cars in a way. Life becomes more efficient, but they\u2019ll require far more energy generation, for example. There are always second-order consequences. SK: But think of how many people are killed in driving accidents, versus terrorist attacks. Humans have many great qualities, but being able to drive a lethal machine consistently isn\u2019t one of them. So when we take that into perspective, it\u2019s really important that we build autonomous vehicles. You [voice] a legitimate concern, and often when there are step changes, there are discontinuities along the way that lead to side effects that aren\u2019t great. That comes down to several things. First, infrastructure will have to keep up. We\u2019ll also have to create regulations that don\u2019t lead to the worst outcomes. One our investments, Lilium in Munich, has built an entirely electric air taxi service that\u2019s built on vertical takeoff. It\u2019s nimble. It\u2019s quiet enough to operate in city environments. On roads, cars are constrained by 2D terrain and buildings, but [in the air] if you can do dynamic air traffic control, it opens up far much efficient transport. If you can get from downtown London to Heathrow [airport] in five minutes versus 50 minutes in a Tesla? That\u2019s far more energy efficient."

            "content": "By , Kris Osborn Published January 06, 2020 File photo - A 10th Mountain Division Soldier fires an M4 rifle during a platoon Situational Training Exercise at a range in Arta, Djibouti, Aug. 25, 2018. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Haley D. Phillips) Targets emerge in seconds, incoming enemy fire puts lives at risk and shifting combat dynamics require immediate, on-the-spot decisions in a matter of seconds -- all as soldiers navigate the complex web of threats during all-out, high-risk ground-warfare. These kinds of predicaments, which characterize much of what soldiers train to face, are immeasurably improved by emerging applications of AI; artificial intelligence can already gather, fuse, organize and analyze otherwise disparate pools of combat-sensitive data for individual soldiers. Target information from night vision sensors, weapons sights, navigational devices and enemy fire detection systems can increasingly be gathered and organized for individual human soldier decision-makers. However, what comes after this? Where will AI go next in terms of changing modern warfare for Army infantry on the move in war? The Army Research Laboratory is now immersed in a complex new series of research and experimentation initiatives to explore a \u201cnext-level\u201d of AI. Fundamentally, this means not only using advanced algorithms to ease the cognitive burden for individual soldiers -- but also network and integrate otherwise stovepiped applications of AI systems. In effect, this could be described as performing AI-enabled analytics on groups of AI systems themselves. \u201cAutonomy is doing things in a snipped way that can be connected. We can benefit from an overarching AI approach, something that looks at the entire mission. Right now our autonomy solves very discreet problems that are getting more complicated,\u201d J. Corde Lane, Ph.D., director, Human Research and Engineering, CCDC-Army Research Laboratory, told Warrior in an interview. F-35 SET FOR LASER BOOST What does this mean? In essence, it translates into a way combat commanders will not only receive AI-generated input from individual soldiers but also be able to assess how different AI systems can themselves be compared to one another and analyzed as a dynamic group. For instance, Lane explained, perhaps multiple soldier-centric AI-empowered assessments can be collected and analyzed in relation to one another with a mind to how they impact a broader, squad-level combat dynamic. In particular, simultaneous analysis of multiple soldier-oriented AI system can help determine the best course of action for an entire unit, in relation to an overall mission objective. \u201cWhat is the entire mission and possible courses of action? Do we optimize the logistics flow? Find targets as the dynamic battlefield gets more complex? The Commander can draw upon advanced AI to explore new options,\u201d Lane explained. Therefore, in addition to drawing upon algorithms able to organize data within a given individual system, future AI will encompass using real-time analytics to assess multiple systems simultaneously and how they impact one another to offer an overall integrated view. All of this progress, just as is the case now, will still rely heavily upon human decision-making faculties to optimize its added value for combat. Integrating a collective picture, drawing upon a greater range of variables will require soldiers to incorporate new tactics and methods of analysis to best leverage the additional available information. SOLDIERS USE AI TO FIRE PRECISION GRENADES, GUIDE DRONE ATTACKS \u201cWhen we have new and improved autonomy coming in, soldiers need to know how to use that. How do you keep the soldier always at the center and adapt to them as you adapt to the new AI?\u201d Lane asked. Perhaps one soldier receives organized sensor-driven targeting data relevant to a specific swath of terrain, while another AI system is organizing variables to determine the supply flow of ammunition, fuel or other logistical factors. \u201cData never seen cannot be learned. It is not about AI, but combining AI with a soldier who has the concept of an entire mission. AI provides information and then they get put together. When you are under fire, you are going to need different types of information,\u201d Lane explained. For example, comparing and analyzing various AI systems to help engender a collective picture of some kind might enable a commander to know \u201cif you go this way you will use more fuel but it will be safer,\u201d as Lane explained. HOW AI CHANGES ATTACK MISSIONS FOR US FIGHTER JETS AND BOMBERS Interestingly, Lane\u2019s point about the irreplaceable characteristics of human cognition in the face of new AI-driven technologies is anticipated in a 2017 essay from the Chatham House Royal Institute of International Affairs, called \u201cArtificial Intelligence and the Future of War.\u201d The essay, written by M.L. Cummings, states that \u201creplicating the intangible concept of intuition, knowledge-based reasoning and true expertise is, for now, beyond the realm of computers.\u201d Mathematically oriented computer algorithms naturally face limitations when it comes to things like judgments, feelings or quickly assessing not-yet-seen information; an AI-database can only be as effective as the information it already has stored in its database. While Machine-Learning techniques continue to accelerate the pace at which an existing AI database can quickly integrate and perform analytics on new information, AI-infused computing can only make decisions or solve problems in relation to the information it already has stored. Now it goes without saying that these databases are increasingly vast, almost seeming limitless, yet they do need to consistently be fed with not-yet-stored information of great relevance to wartime decisions. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Chatham House essay puts it this way: \u201cEvery autonomous system that interacts in a dynamic environment must construct a world model and continually update that model. This means that the world must be perceived (or sensed through cameras, microphones and/or tactile sensors) and then reconstructed in such a way that the computer \u2018brain\u2019 has an effective and updated model of the world it is in before it can make decisions. The fidelity of the world model and the timeliness of its updates are the keys to an effective autonomous system.\u201d (Artificial Intelligence and the Future of War\u201d M.L.

(Credit: FlyEM/Janelia Research Campus) Scientists have created the most detailed 3D map of an organism brain to date. The mesmerizing threads of blue, yellow, purple and green represent thousands of brain cells and millions of connections found inside the brain of a fruit fly. This high-resolution map, known as a \"connectome,\" only makes up one-third of a fruit fly's brain but includes a large region involved in learning, navigation, smell and vision. Scientists found over 4,000 different types of neurons, including those involved in the fly's circadian rhythm \u2014 or internal clock \u2014 that might help researchers learn a bit more about how the insect sleeps, according to the publicly released data. This map, a collaboration between scientists at Google and the Janelia Research Campus in Virginia, took two years to create. The team started out by cutting a fruit fly brain into extremely thin slices using a hot knife \u2014 and then imaging each slice under an electron microscope. Afterward, they stitched the images together to create a large map, tracing the paths of the neurons through the brain, according to the statement. Related: 3D Images: Exploring the Human Brain The point of such maps is to reveal something about how specific physical connections in the brain are linked to distinct behaviors. But following each individual neuron in a journey across the brain is painstaking work \u2014 and critics note that such maps have not yet led to a major discovery, according to The Verge. The only organism to have its entire brain mapped this way is the roundworm C. elegans \u2014 a wriggly critter that only harbors around 300 to 400 neurons and around 7,000 synapses, or the junctions between brain cells. Other teams have attempted to map the human brain in lower resolution. But considering that the human brain contains 86 billion neurons, creating such a map will likely take some more time. The new map was published on Jan. 21 in the database BioRxiv, and it has not yet been peer reviewed.

            "content": "Last month, researchers at OpenAI in San Francisco revealed an algorithm capable of learning, through trial and error, how to manipulate the pieces of a Rubik's Cube using a robotic hand. It was a remarkable research feat, but it required more than 1,000 desktop computers plus a dozen machines running specialized graphics chips crunching intensive calculations for several months. The effort may have consumed about 2.8 gigawatt-hours of electricity, estimates Evan Sparks, CEO of Determined AI, a startup that provides software to help companies manage AI projects. That\u2019s roughly equal to the output of three nuclear power plants for an hour. A spokesperson for OpenAI questioned the calculation, noting that it makes several assumptions. But OpenAI declined to disclose further details of the project or offer an estimate of the electricity it consumed. Artificial intelligence routinely produces startling achievements, as computers learn to recognize images, converse, beat humans at sophisticated games, and drive vehicles. But all those advances require staggering amounts of computing power\u2014and electricity\u2014to devise and train algorithms. And as the damage caused by climate change becomes more apparent, AI experts are increasingly troubled by those energy demands. \u201cThe concern is that machine-learning algorithms in general are consuming more and more energy, using more data, training for longer and longer,\u201d says Sasha Luccioni, a postdoctoral researcher at Mila, an AI research institute in Canada. It\u2019s not just a worry for academics. As more companies across more industries begin to use AI, there\u2019s growing fear that the technology will only deepen the climate crisis. Sparks says that Determined.ai is working with a pharmaceutical firm that\u2019s already using huge AI models. \u201cAs an industry, it\u2019s worth thinking about how we want to combat this,\u201d he adds. Some AI researchers are thinking about it. They\u2019re using tools to track the energy demands of their algorithms, or taking steps to offset their emissions. A growing number are touting the energy efficiency of their algorithms in research papers and at conferences. As the costs of AI rise, the AI industry is developing a new appetite for algorithms that burn fewer kilowatts. Luccioni recently helped launch a website that lets AI researchers roughly calculate the carbon footprint of their algorithms. She is also testing a more sophisticated approach\u2014code that can be added to an AI program to track the energy use of individual computer chips. Luccioni and others are also trying to persuade companies that offer tools for tracking the performance of code to include some measure of energy or carbon footprint. \u201cHopefully this will go toward full transparency,\u201d she says. \u201cSo that people will include in the footnotes \u2018we emitted X tons of carbon, which we offset.\u2019\u201d The energy required to power cutting-edge AI has been on a steep upward curve for some time. Data published by OpenAI shows that the computing power required for key AI landmarks over the past few years, such as DeepMind\u2019s Go-playing program AlphaZero, has doubled roughly every 3.4 months\u2014increasing 300,000 times between 2012 and 2018. That\u2019s faster than the rate at which computing power historically increased, the phenomenon known as Moore\u2019s Law (named after Gordon Moore, cofounder of Intel.) Recent advances in natural language processing\u2014an AI technique that helps machines parse, interpret, and generate text\u2014have proven especially power-hungry. A research paper from a team at UMass Amherst found that training a single large NLP model may consume as much energy as a car over its entire lifetime\u2014including the energy needed to build it. Training a powerful machine-learning algorithm often means running huge banks of computers for days, if not weeks. The fine-tuning required to perfect an algorithm, by for example searching through different neural network architectures to find the best one, can be especially computationally intensive. For all the hand-wringing, though, it remains difficult to measure how much energy AI actually consumes, and even harder to predict how much of a problem it could become. The Department of Energy estimates that data centers account for about 2 percent of total US electricity usage. Worldwide, data centers consume about 200 terawatt hours of power per year\u2014more than some countries. And the forecast is for significant growth over the next decade, with some predicting that by 2030, computing and communications technology will consume between 8 percent and 20 percent of the world\u2019s electricity, with data centers accounting for a third of that. In recent years, companies offering cloud computing services have sought to address spiraling power consumption and offset carbon emissions with varying measures of success. Google, for example, claims \u201czero net carbon emissions\u201d for its data centers, thanks to extensive renewable energy purchases. Microsoft last week announced a plan to become \u201ccarbon negative\u201d by 2030, meaning it would offset all of the carbon produced by the company over its history. OpenAI signed a deal to use Microsoft's cloud last July. It isn\u2019t clear how the AI boom will fit with the bigger picture of data center energy use, or how it might alter it. Cloud providers do not disclose the overall energy demands of machine-learning systems. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google all declined to comment. Jonathan Koomey, a researcher and consultant who tracks data center energy use, cautions against drawing too many conclusions from cutting-edge AI demos. He notes that AI algorithms often run on specialized chips that are more efficient, so new chip architectures may offset some of the projected demand for compute power. He also says that the IT industry has in the past offset rising energy demands in one domain by lowering energy use in others. \u201cPeople are likely to take isolated anecdotes and extrapolate to get eye popping numbers, and these numbers are almost always too high,\u201d Koomey says. Still, as companies and other organizations increasingly use artificial intelligence, experts say it will become important to understand the technology\u2019s energy footprint, both in data centers and in other devices and gadgets. \u201cI would agree that the analysis community needs to get a handle on it,\u201d says Eric Masanet, a professor at Northwestern University who leads its Energy and Resource Systems Analysis Laboratory. Some AI researchers aren\u2019t waiting for the industry to wake up. Luccioni of Mila helped organize a workshop on climate change last month at an important AI conference, NeurIPS, and she was pleased to find that the event was standing room only. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest in this,\u201d she says. The Allen Institute for AI, a research institute founded by the late Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen, has also called for greater awareness of AI\u2019s environmental impact. The institute\u2019s CEO, Oren Etzioni, says he is encouraged by the efforts of researchers, as many papers now include some account of the computational intensity of a particular algorithm or experiment. Etzioni adds that the industry as a whole is gradually waking up to energy efficiency. Even if this is largely because of the cost involved with training large AI models, it could help prevent AI from contributing to a looming climate catastrophe. \u201cAI is clearly moving toward lighter models and greener AI,\u201d he says.

            "content": "Predicting the future is hard, but that doesn't stop people from trying\u2014especially people named Elon Musk. As he well knows, being bold is pretty much the only way thought castles can become concrete (or wood, brick, or metal). In this list, WIRED has gathered a handful of far-reaching goals as a framework for what to expect in the decade ahead. Space colonies. A mega-expansion in genome sequencing. Sweet little nuclear power plants. It's never too early to start holding the promise-makers responsible for their claims. After all, even a bajillionaire needs an accountability buddy. Welcome to the Moon Base When the last person left the moon in 1972, few could have predicted that humans wouldn\u2019t return for another 50 years. But NASA says this time around things will be different. The agency is planning a crewed mission to the moon in 2024, and this time it wants to stick around. The idea of the Artemis mission is to lay the foundation for a permanent human presence on and around the moon, which will then serve as a jump-off point for the agency\u2019s journey to Mars. When Artemis was first announced, it was easy to be incredulous: The agency wants to use a rocket that hasn\u2019t flown yet, it lacks the necessary funds for a moon mission ... the list goes on. But this year NASA has made big strides on the mission. The agency has selected a handful of companies to build components for its lunar gateway, a space station that will be in orbit around the moon, and it has solicited designs for a lunar lander. If NASA does hit its 2024 target for a crewed mission to the moon, it\u2019s not so crazy to think it might have a permanent moon base by 2030. \u2014Daniel Oberhaus Climate Apocalypse Now In October 2018 the UN warned that humanity has 12 years left to avoid catastrophic climate change. That means that by 2030, we\u2019ll need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions in half, not so much a tall order as a towering one, given that emissions are still rising year to year. In fairness, the world won\u2019t suddenly end on January 1, 2030, if we don\u2019t meet that goal. But the report is spot-on in its mantra: The faster we switch to a world economy run on renewable energy, the better we can attenuate the consequences\u2014stronger storms, rising seas, fiercer wildfires. So what can we do? For one, we need carbon taxes the world over: Release greenhouse gases and you pay a fee, which incentivizes the adoption of green energy. We have to massively subsidize solar panels and electric cars. We have to bolster public transportation and redesign cities to discourage the use of cars. And this may sound niche, but it\u2019s hugely important: AC units need a fundamental redesign to be more efficient or even sequester CO2, as demand for them soars in lockstep with global temperatures. \u2014Matt Simon Genomic Mega Millions If you think you\u2019re currently living in the age of Big DNA, think again. The next decade will see a more than hundredfold boom in the world\u2019s output of human genetic data. The drop in sequencing costs is shifting DNA testing out of the research lab and into mainstream medical practice. Population-based sequencing projects in more than a dozen countries, including the US, are expected to produce 60 million genomes by 2025. By 2030, China hopes to add another 100 million from its own precision medicine initiative. The impact is hard to even imagine. To date, only about a million people have had their whole genomes sequenced. And it\u2019s not a very diverse cohort. More data from all over the globe will allow for more powerful, fine-grained analyses of how genes shape health and behavior. Very large genetic data sets are ideal for a new technique called Mendelian randomization, which mimics clinical trials, allowing researchers to tease apart causes and correlations. Bigger samples will also make it possible to forecast even complex traits\u2014like height or susceptibility to heart disease\u2014from DNA. A world so saturated with genetic data will come with its own risks. The emergence of genetic surveillance states and the end of genetic privacy loom. Technical advances in encrypting genomes may help ameliorate some of those threats. But new laws will need to keep the risks and benefits of so much genetic knowledge in balance. \u2014Megan Molteni Teeny Tiny Nuclear Power Plants By 2030, the Vogtle power plant in Georgia, the only nuclear power station currently under construction in the US, will have been running for a few years. It's likely to be the decade's only new large-scale nuclear power plant to come online, but that doesn\u2019t mean the United States is abandoning fission energy. Instead, expect to see small nuclear reactors start popping up. Just a fraction of the size of a typical nuclear reactor, these advanced ones can be mass-produced and easily shipped anywhere in the country, no matter how remote. The first small reactors, developed by a company called NuScale Power, should start splitting atoms at Idaho National Laboratories in 2026. The Department of Energy is also working to get even smaller reactors, known as microreactors, churning out electrons at a federal facility by 2027. Nuclear energy gets a bad rap in some American environmental circles and it\u2019s not hard to see why. The meltdown at Three Mile Island and the decades-long debate about storing nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain have made people skittish about the prospects of this carbon-free energy source, but the UN and many experts say fission energy will be key to hitting our climate goals. The world needs to halve its carbon emissions by 2030, and embracing the new generation of nuclear reactors may be key to making that happen. \u2014Daniel Oberhaus Elon Musk's Plan for Mars Sending life to Mars has been Elon Musk\u2019s goal from day one, and this is the decade he has pegged for his touchdown on the red planet. Originally, he wanted to ship off some plants in a greenhouse, but as SpaceX came to dominate the new space industry, Musk\u2019s ambitions have risen in tandem to include a full-fledged Mars colony. In 2019 he showed off, for the first time, the rocket that could make that happen. Musk\u2019s Mars timeline is predictably slippery. In 2017 he predicted SpaceX would send a cargo mission to Mars by 2022. The following year, he said the first crewed mission to Mars would happen in seven to ten years, or no later than 2028. Musk is notorious for wildly underestimating the amount of time it takes to accomplish his ambitious goals, so don't schedule your launch parties just yet. Still, he tends to follow through on his promises\u2014eventually. \u2014Daniel Oberhaus Goodbye, Poverty! Predictions for the future often have a sci-fi bent: jet packs, flying cars, brain-computer hybrids. The United Nations is supposed to stick to more solid ground, but some of its Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 sound nearly as fantastical. In a mere 10 years, the UN plans to eradicate poverty \u201cin all its forms everywhere.\u201d No big deal. The UN already declared October 17 International Poverty Eradication Day. But elevating the lives of those subsisting on less than $1.25 a day will take a little more. The good news is that crushing global poverty has declined significantly: The World Bank reports that 1.1 billion fewer people live in extreme poverty than did in 1990. The organization has been working with countries to improve education, gender equality, food security, social services, and more. But the gains are unevenly distributed, and climate change now threatens to undo much of the progress, pushing millions back into destitution and creating a \u201cclimate apartheid.\u201d This is already happening in Central America and Africa, where drought has caused millions to leave their homes. The prospect of ending poverty seems, well, poor. But let's face it, the future is unknowable. The 1900 edition of Ladies\u2019 Home Journal predicted that, within the century, pneumatic tubes would deliver goods to homes and the letters C, X, and Q would drop out of the alphabet. Yet it also foresaw the mobile phone and color photography. Strong science coupled with political will might yet turn climate change around, and transform the UN\u2019s predictions from a dream into reality. \u2014Sara Harrison More Great WIRED Stories Instagram, my daughter, and me Tweak these Google Chrome settings to level up your browsing Welcome to Rachel, Nevada\u2014the town closest to Area 51 The Irishman gets de-aging right\u2014no tracking dots necessary Ewoks are the most tactically advanced fighting force in Star Wars \ud83d\udc41 Will AI as a field \"hit the wall\" soon?

            "content": "Years of mounting uneasiness around smartphones and the internet have established a new genre on the bookshelf: the technology self-help book. Last decade began with diagnoses of our troubled minds, in tomes like Nicholas Carr\u2019s The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains , published in 2010. More recently, the genre has shifted toward solutions. A whole shelf\u2019s worth of books dedicated to directly addressing this techno-discontentment came out in 2019, with titles like Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life (by Nir Eyal), Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World (by Cal Newport), and How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy (by Jenny Odell). Undergirding this genre is an implicit dialectic: Technology has changed us, robbed us of something important, and we must get it back. It\u2019s your devices versus your best life. Just in time for a new decade, though, several fresh books offer a more measured approach to living in the age of technology. These are not self-help books, or even books that confront our relationship with technology head-on. Instead, they examine the realities of a tech-saturated world and offer a few simple ideas for rewriting bad habits, reviewing the devices we actually need, and relearning how to listen amid all the noise. Few people claim more authority on the topic of coexisting with tech than B. J. Fogg, whose new book, Tiny Habits , was published December 31. The founder of Stanford University\u2019s Behavior Design Lab, Fogg has spent more than a decade studying the architecture of human behavior. He\u2019s interested in the little nudges that change the way people make decisions, and his work has been used by the tech industry to develop habit-forming products. His first book, from 2003, focused on Persuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Do , and his classroom has educated the likes of Ed Baker, who would go on to lead growth at Facebook and Uber, and Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, the founders of Instagram. In Tiny Habits, Fogg neatly translates a decade of research into a three-step program: Find a behavior you want to adopt (reading the newspaper rather than Twitter), tack it onto an existing routine (drinking a cup of coffee every morning) and then celebrate, liberally, every time it\u2019s done (self-congratulation works). The last step is not to be skipped; celebration is to Foggianism as zen is to Buddhism. He suggests starting with microscopic behaviors (just read one headline in the newspaper every morning after you drink your cup of coffee) to encourage better adoption. A similar program works for undoing bad habits. Fogg\u2019s method is meant to work for any habit\u2014not just escaping the Instagram scroll, but remembering to floss your teeth, developing an exercise routine, or practicing the guitar. That\u2019s because all human behavior, according to Fogg, follows the same basic formula: We form a habit to do something when we are motivated, able, and are prompted to do so. (The design of apps like Instagram, a careful reader will note, also follow this basic formula.) The book begins with an overview of this basic idea (replete with graphics and charts) and then spends a chapter explaining each variable. Tiny Habits isn't about how technology itself has derailed our good choices, though it\u2019s sprinkled liberally with complaints of bad tech hygiene: a student who scrolls through Facebook every morning rather than getting up to exercise, the husband who can\u2019t put his phone down during dinner. But Fogg is far from a tech teetotaler. He also offers examples of how posting about new habits can hold people accountable, and how social technology can help people change their behaviors together, for good. If Fogg\u2019s approach to health tech habits is a matter of searching within, the writer Kyle Chayka suggests looking at the stuff around you. His forthcoming book, The Longing for Less (out January 21), chronicles the rise of minimalism. Chayka, who has written about the ways algorithms flatten our personal taste and the homogeneity of the Silicon Valley aesthetic, seems suspicious about whether technology\u2019s influence has been mostly good or bad. His curiosity about minimalism, then, reads like a response to a time when everyone is bombarded with digital information, superfluous gadgets, and online advertising designed to compel instantaneous purchases. Given all the digital detritus, it makes sense that some people are longing for some empty space. But this isn\u2019t really a book about technology, and Chayka offers a more careful consideration of the movement\u2019s origins. The Longing for Less tries to understand the current obsession with minimalism in all its complexity: the influence of Silicon Valley, yes, but also capitalism, the economy in the early 2000s, Stoic philosophy, Marie Kondo. Over four chapters\u2014\u201dReduction,\u201d \u201cEmptiness,\u201d \u201cSilence,\u201d and \u201cShadow\u201d\u2014Chayka takes the reader through history and around the world, giving equal consideration to minimalists like Steve Jobs (who lived in a giant house that remained entirely empty) as he does to Cicero. It would be a mistake to take The Longing for Less as a work of pragmatic advice. It doesn't make a compelling argument either for or against minimalism in practice. As for technology, Chayka includes a few anecdotes about taming it in his own life: Throughout the book, he mentions experiences turning off his Wi-Fi, visiting a sensory-deprivation tank, and spending $700 on a retreat in rural Sweden where he is forced to surrender all devices for a week. By the end of the book, he doesn\u2019t seem to find nirvana in all the silence\u2014but he gives readers a few reasons to hold off on buying that new iPhone."

Wired reports that on January 6, the CDC issued a warning about a possible virus outbreak in China, the WHO made a similar announcement on January 9 after a number of pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan. But both were beaten to the report by a Canadian AI health monitoring platform called BlueDot which sent warnings to customers on December 31, 2019. BlueDot uses an AI-driven algorithm to search through foreign-language news reports, animal and plant disease networks, and official statements from government bodies in order to warn its clients of danger zones such as Wuhan which has become the center of the coronavirus outbreak in China. Public health officials at the WHO and CDC are forced to rely on reports from Chinese officials \u2014 who are often not very forthcoming with information \u2014 but BlueDot relies on artificial intelligence that may prove faster than official statements. Kamran Khan, BlueDot\u2019s founder and CEO, commented on the algorithm stating: \u201cWe know that governments may not be relied upon to provide information in a timely fashion. We can pick up news of possible outbreaks, little murmurs or forums or blogs of indications of some kind of unusual events going on.\u201d Khan worked as a hospital infectious disease specialist in Toronto during the SARS epidemic of 2003 and commented on the current coronavirus situation stating: \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of deja vu right now. In 2003, I watched the virus overwhelm the city and cripple the hospital. There was an enormous amount of mental and physical fatigue, and I thought, \u2018Let\u2019s not do this again.\u2019\u201d Khan launched BlueDot in 2014 and raised $9.4 million in venture capital funding, the firm now employees 40 people including physicians and programmers who have worked to develop the disease surveillance analytic program that uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to sort through news reports in 65 languages as well as airline data and animal disease outbreak reports. \u201cWhat we have done is use natural language processing and machine learning to train this engine to recognize whether this is an outbreak of anthrax in Mongolia versus a reunion of the heavy metal band Anthrax,\u201d Kahn says.

            "content": "AP Photo/Charles Krupa The MIT Technology Review reported in 2018 that Amazon Alexa home assistant devices may actually be listening in on people\u2019s daily lives even when not given commands. Despite such warnings, the e-commerce giant sold out of Alexa-powered devices before Christmas as their popularity continues to grow unabated. The MIT Technology Review reported in an article titled \u201cYes, Alexa is recording mundane details of your life, and it\u2019s creepy as hell,\u201d that Amazon Alexa home assistant devices are listening in on people\u2019s conversations, a theory that has been around for some time but has never been confirmed. The MIT Technology Review reports: Beyond all the things I\u2019ve clearly asked Alexa to do, in the past several months it has also tuned in, frequently several times a day, for no obvious reason. It\u2019s heard me complain to my dad about something work-related, chide my toddler about eating dinner, and talk to my husband\u2014the kinds of normal, everyday things you say at home when you think no one else is listening. And that\u2019s precisely why it\u2019s terrifying: this sort of mundane chitchat is my mundane chitchat. I invited Alexa into our living room to make it easier to listen to Pandora and occasionally check the weather, not to keep a log of intimate family details or record my kid saying \u201cMommy, we going car\u201d and forward it to Amazon\u2019s cloud storage. The MIT Technology Review notes that constant recording is one of the unfortunate downsides of home assistants that constantly listen for wake words such as \u201cAlexa!\u201d or \u201cHey, Siri!\u201d Through 2019, Amazon faced continual bad news about its Alexa-powered devices on the subject of user privacy and security. Reports were published showing that Amazon employees and contractors located in India, Costa Rica, and Romania had ready access to users\u2019 recordings and spent nine hours a day listening to the snippets. The work is mostly mundane. One worker in Boston said he mined accumulated voice data for specific utterances such as \u201cTaylor Swift\u201d and annotated them to indicate the searcher meant the musical artist. Occasionally the listeners pick up things Echo owners likely would rather stay private: a woman singing badly off key in the shower, say, or a child screaming for help. The teams use internal chat rooms to share files when they need help parsing a muddled word\u2014or come across an amusing recording. This revelation led to a lawsuit against Amazon which claimed that Jeff Bezos\u2019 Big Tech giant was breaking the law by recording children without their parent\u2019s consent. In another threat to security, researchers in Tokyo documented that Amazon\u2019s voice assistant hardware could be hacked with a $5 laser pointer. Despite the negativity about Amazon\u2019s devices recording users when they don\u2019t expect it, sales of Alexa-powered devices have continued to rise. Early in 2019, Amazon announced that it had sold 100 million Alexa devices. Sales haven\u2019t slowed down since then. Although the company has not released Christmas sales figures, for the third quarter of 2019, it sold more than 10 million devices and enjoys a 36 percent share of the market. It\u2019s next closest competitor, the Chinese company Alibaba, has a 13 percent market share. Breitbart News has previously published a guide explaining how to stop Amazon employees from having access to Alexa recordings, however, this does not stop the device from recording users\u2019 daily interactions but rather protects them from being listened to by Amazon employees directly.

            "content": "The New York Times published an investigation recently into a little-known startup that helps law enforcement match photos of unknown people to their online images using facial recognition, and the privacy issues that are raised by the company and its massive database of photos. The New York Times writes in an article titled \u201cThe Secretive Company That Might End Privacy as We Know It\u201d that a new tech startup that has been working with law enforcement could raise serious privacy issues for members of the public. Clearview AI, a facial recognition tech startup, has developed a system that allows users to upload a photo of a person to the app and see public photos of that person, along with links to where those photos appeared. The system scrapes information from Facebook, YouTube, Venmo and millions of other websites to help law enforcement track down individuals. The New York Times writes: Federal and state law enforcement officers said that while they had only limited knowledge of how Clearview works and who is behind it, they had used its app to help solve shoplifting, identity theft, credit card fraud, murder and child sexual exploitation cases. Until now, technology that readily identifies everyone based on his or her face has been taboo because of its radical erosion of privacy. Tech companies capable of releasing such a tool have refrained from doing so; in 2011, Google\u2019s chairman at the time said it was the one technology the company had held back because it could be used \u201cin a very bad way.\u201d Some large cities, including San Francisco, have barred police from using facial recognition technology. The technology is reportedly being used by multiple law enforcement agencies amongst other groups, but many security experts have warned that the technology could easily be weaponized: \u201cThe weaponization possibilities of this are endless,\u201d said Eric Goldman, co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University. \u201cImagine a rogue law enforcement officer who wants to stalk potential romantic partners, or a foreign government using this to dig up secrets about people to blackmail them or throw them in jail.\u201d The New York Times also notes that while investigating Clearview and finding little accurate public information about the company, Clearview began to investigate the Times reporter looking into the company: While the company was dodging me, it was also monitoring me. At my request, a number of police officers had run my photo through the Clearview app. They soon received phone calls from company representatives asking if they were talking to the media \u2014 a sign that Clearview has the ability and, in this case, the appetite to monitor whom law enforcement is searching for. Facial recognition technology has always been controversial. It makes people nervous about Big Brother. It has a tendency to deliver false matches for certain groups, like people of color. And some facial recognition products used by the police \u2014 including Clearview\u2019s \u2014 haven\u2019t been vetted by independent experts.
