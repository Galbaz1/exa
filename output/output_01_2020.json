            "content": "The informal TechCrunch book club is now venturing into the short story \u201cExhalation,\u201d the second piece in Ted Chiang\u2019s eponymous collection. Today\u2019s story gets at the meaning of existence, climate change, community and connection all within a beautifully intricate story that runs for just a few handfuls of pages. I was hooked, and so let\u2019s talk about some of the messages Chiang wants to send as part of the piece. Some quick notes: Want to join the conversation? Feel free to email me your thoughts at bookclub@techcrunch.com or join some of the discussions on Reddit or Twitter (hashtag: #TCBookClub) Follow these informal book club articles here: https://techcrunch.com/book-review/. That page also has a built-in RSS feed for posts exclusively in the Book Review category, which is very low volume. Feel free to add your comments in our TechCrunch comments section below this post. Thoughts on \u201cExhalation\u201d Chiang has constructed a magnificent story around the most basic and forgettable of substances: air. He starts the story with what otherwise appears to be a normal day in the life of an everyday human, but within a few paragraphs, we learn that the narrator is \u201cgoing to the filling stations\u201d and it slowly dawns on us that the narrator \u2014 and all the people that populate this imaginative world \u2014 are actually some form of cybernetic beings, dependent on a mechanical supply of air for their machined bodies. We learn that these filling stations, where people pick up their air supply, aren\u2019t just refueling utilities, but are key community outposts where connections are formed between people. \u201cFor the filling stations are the primary venue for social conversation, the places from which we draw emotional sustenance as well as physical.\u201d But that\u2019s not all, Chiang writes. \u201c\u2026 there is camaraderie derived from the awareness that all our air comes from the same source\u2026\u201d As we learn as the story progresses, air isn\u2019t just present in this universe \u2014 it is fundamentally the connective substance not only between every individual, but also the past and the future. Memories held in the brains of these individuals aren\u2019t inscribed, but are rather reconfigured as air passes through them. Therefore, what is memorable \u2014 what is most visible \u2014 is ultimately a function of what is not even seen. The narrator describes this discovery as he investigates his own brain in an experiment: Watching the oscillations of these flakes of gold, I saw that air does not, as we had always assumed, simply provide power to the engine that realizes our thoughts. Air is in fact the very medium of our thoughts. All that we are is a pattern of air flow. What\u2019s incredible about this story is that Chiang pushes this metaphor another layer deeper. The narrator learns that the world relies on the pressure difference between the air in the atmosphere and the air in each individual\u2019s body, and that this difference is decreasing. Suddenly, the fate of the entire universe has become clear: There may well be air everywhere, but it\u2019s the differential that matters, and that differential is slowly receding with every breath, every twitch of a limb and stray thought. Equilibrium \u2014 and therefore death \u2014 is just around the corner. Gloriously, Chiang describes the dawn of time: The universe began as an enormous breath being held. Who knows why, but whatever the reason, I am glad that it did, because I owe my existence to that fact. All my desires and ruminations are no more and no less than eddy currents generated by the gradual exhalation of our universe. And until this great exhalation is finished, my thoughts live on. This is an ambitious leap and one that springs beautifully from the page. We have gone from air as individual sustenance, to air as community resource and connective tissue, to air as the very meaning of existence, tied into a fate where we already know how the final chapter will be written. Here is the substance we never think about, and instead of being nothing it is actually everything we care about. There is a parallel here of course to our own world. In much the way the everyday actions of the individuals in this short story deplete the pressure difference of their world and ultimately make it uninhabitable, there is clearly a connection to our own present crisis regarding climate change. How should we handle the fatalism of those climate trendlines that show Earth eventually dying off sometime in the future? The story doesn\u2019t try to minimize that fatalism. In fact, it actively diminishes the idea that there are technical solutions to these problems. Our narrator describes a sect known as the \u201cReversalists,\u201d who attempt to build a machine that can increase the difference in air pressure in the universe. But our narrator isn\u2019t optimistic, and essentially argues that such a machine is impossible to design. Instead, the story exhorts us to revel in the limited time we have in this universe, even knowing that the world is going to come to an inevitable end. \u201cBecause even if a universe\u2019s life span is calculable, the variety of life that is generated within it is not.\u201d Rather than spending our limited time trying to push back the end (of the universe or of our own demise), we should instead ignore that fatal ending and focus on the present, and the wonders that we get to experience while the world is alive for us. I can go on and on about air here, and indeed, multiple re-readings of this chapter have revealed new connections and symbols that are absolutely fascinating. But I want to move on to two other points that I think this short story wants to tell. In the story, our narrator is an anatomist, who learns about a strange set of facts \u2014 that clocks appear to be changing speed in multiple districts in this universe. They learn about these facts, but unlike anyone else, they seem willing to ask more fundamental and deeper questions about why basic mechanics of the universe aren\u2019t what they seem: Most people suspected fraud, a practical joke perpetrated by mischief-makers. I had a different suspicion, a darker one that I dared not voice, but it decided my course of action; I would proceed with my experiment. Our narrator explains that there is a reigning theory about the workings of the brain called the inscription hypothesis, which they reject. By the end of the story though, we see how our narrator\u2019s experiment of opening their own brain and investigating its workings eventually overturned that hypothesis. It\u2019s not only a commentary on the scientific method, but I also feel that there is a point here about asking even the hardest questions about the data that we are seeing in our universe. We talk about this all the time in the startup world, but here we have in clear relief a person who didn\u2019t just accept the prevailing theory of how something worked, or ignored the facts and data from their universe, or avoided approaching the hardest questions they stumbled upon. Instead, they confronted them, and also did so individually, without the consent or approval of others. That\u2019s a reminder that sometimes, when we are on the frontiers of science, that the hardest questions sometimes can\u2019t be answered in collaboration with others \u2014 that the air that connects us breaks down here. The other symbol I loved here is around the \u201cexperiment\u201d itself. Our narrator builds a machine that allows them to dissect their own brain, and in the process allows them to see the true meaning of the universe. Chiang spends a sizable part of the story building up the dissection, going through with it and discussing its implications, and it isn\u2019t hard to see why. The brain dissection is a beautiful metaphor for literally \u201copening our minds\u201d to new experiences and ideas. Our narrator carefully prepares to open their mind, splaying their brain out in a painstaking and careful order to understand its inner workings. As they do this though, they discover who they really are, and also the fate of the universe along the way. It\u2019s a gorgeous symbol, and like so much of this story, a layered opinion about what it means to be an individual and how we relate to each other. As Chiang closes out, \u201cContemplate the marvel that is existence, and rejoice that you are able to do so. I feel I have the right to tell you this because, as I am inscribing these words, I am doing the same.\u201d Some questions for \u201cWhat\u2019s Expected of Us\u201d Next week, we will read the ultra-short story (four pages!), the third part of \u201cExhalation\u201d the collection. It\u2019s an interesting meditation on free will versus destiny, and asks a lot of questions in a taut story. Have comments on what you read? Send them to me at bookclub@techcrunch.com"

            "content": "During this week\u2019s Democratic debate, there was a lot of talk, unsurprisingly, about ensuring the future of this country\u2019s children and grandchildren. Climate change was of particular interest to billionaire Tom Steyer, who said repeatedly that addressing it would be his top priority were he elected U.S. president. As it happens, earlier the same day, we\u2019d spent time on the phone with two venture capitalists who think of almost nothing else every day. The reason: they both invest in so-called deep tech, and they meet routinely with startups whose central focus is on making the world habitable for generations of people to come \u2014 as well as trying to produce outsize financial returns, of course. The two VCs with whom we talked know each other well. Siraj Khaliq is a partner at the global venture firm Atomico, where he tries to find world-changing startups that are enabled by machine learning, AI, and computer vision. He has strong experience in the area, having cofounded The Climate Corporation back in 2006, a company that helps farmers optimize crop yield and that was acquired by Monsanto in 2013 for roughly $1 billion. Seth Bannon is meanwhile a founding partner of Fifty Years, a nearly five-year-old, San Francisco-based seed-stage fund whose stated ambition is backing founders who want to solve the world\u2019s biggest problems. The investors\u2019 interests overlap so much that Khaliq is also one of Fifty Years\u2019s investors. From both, we wanted to know which companies or trends are capturing their imagination and, in some cases, their investment dollars. Following are excerpts from our extended conversation earlier this week. (We thought it was interesting; hopefully you will, too.) TC: Seth, how would you describe what you\u2019re looking to fund at your firm? SB: There\u2019s a Winston Churchill essay [penned nearly 100 years ago] called \u201cFifty Years Hence\u201d that describes what we do. He predicts genomic engineering, synthetic biology, growing meat without animals, nuclear power, satellite telephony. Churchill also notes that because tech changes so quickly that it\u2019s important that technologists take a principled approach to their work. [Inspired by him] we\u2019re backing founders who can make a ton of money while doing good and focusing on health, disease, the climate crisis . . . TC: What does that mean exactly? Are you investing in software? SB: We\u2019re not so enthusiastic about pure software because it\u2019s been so abstracted away that it\u2019s become a commodity. High school students can now build an app, which is great, but it also means that competitive pressures are very high. There are a thousand funds focused on software seed investing. Fortunately, you can now launch a synthetic biology startup with seed funding, and that wasn\u2019t possible 10 years ago. There are a lot of infrastructural advancements happening that makes [deep tech investing even with smaller checks] interesting. TC: Siraj, you also invest exclusively on frontier, or deep tech, at Atomico. What\u2019s your approach to funding startups? SK: We do Series A [deals] onward and don\u2019t do seed stage. We primarily focus on Europe. But there\u2019s lot of common thinking between us and Seth. As a fund, we\u2019re looking for big problems that change the world, sometimes at companies that won\u2019t necessarily be big in five years but if you look out 10 years could be necessary for humanity. So we\u2019re trying to anticipate all of these big trends and focus on three or four theses a year and talk as much as we can with academics and other experts to understand what\u2019s going on. Founders then know we have an informed view. Last year, we focused on synthetic biology, which is a becoming so broad a category that it\u2019s time to start subdividing it. We were also doing AI-based drug discovery and quantum computing and we started to spend some time on energy as well. We also [continued an earlier focus on ] the future of manufacturing and industry. We see a number of trends that make [the latter] attractive, especially in Europe where manufacturing hasn\u2019t yet been digitized. TC: Seth, you mentioned synthetic biology infrastructure. Can you elaborate on what you\u2019re seeing that\u2019s interesting on this front? SB: You\u2019ve maybe heard of directed evolution, technology that allows biologists to use the power of evolution to get microbes or other biological machines to do what they want them to do that would have been impossible before. [Editor\u2019s note: here, Bannon talks a bit about Frances Arnold, the Nobel Prize-winning chemist who was awarded the honor in 2018 for developing the technique.] So we\u2019re excited to back [related] startups. One, Solugen, enzymatically makes industrial chemicals [by combining genetically modified enzymes with organic compounds, like plant sugars]. Hydrogen peroxide is a $6 billion dollar industry, and it\u2019s currently made through a petroleum-based process in seven-football-field-long production plants that sometimes explode and kill people. TC: Is this then akin to Zymergen, which develops molecules in order to create unique specialty materials? SB: Zymergen mainly works as a kind of consultant to help companies engineer strains that they want. Solugen is a vertically integrated chemicals company, so it [creates its formulations], then sells directly into industry. TC: How does this relate to new architectures? SB: The way to think about it is that there\u2019s a bunch of application-level companies, but as synthetic biology companies start to take off, there\u2019s a bunch of emerging infrastructure layer companies. One of these is Ansa Biotechnologies, which has a fully enzymatic process for writing DNA. Like Twist, which went public, they make DNA to sell to customers in the biotech industry. But whereas Twist is using a chemical process to make DNA, Ansa\u2019s approach is fully enzymatic. [Editor\u2019s note: More on the competition in this emerging space here.] Also, if you look at plant-based alternatives to meat, they\u2019re more sustainable but also far more expensive than traditional beef. Why is that? Well plant-based chicken is more expensive because the processing infrastructure being used is more than 10 years behind real chicken processing, where you\u2019ll see robot arms that cut up chicken so efficiently that it looks like a Tesla factory. [Alternative meat] companies are basically using these extruders built in the \u201970s because the industry has been so small, and that\u2019s because there\u2019s been a lot of skepticism from the investment community in these companies. Or there was. The performance of Beyond Meat\u2019s IPO ended it. Now there\u2019s a rush of founders and dollars into that space, and whenever you have a space where the core infrastructure has been neglected, there\u2019s opportunity. A former mechanical engineer with Boeing has started a company, Rebellyous Foods, to basically build the AWS for the plant-based food industry, for example. She\u2019s using [the machines she\u2019s building] to sell plant-based chicken nuggets, [but that\u2019s the longer-term plan]. TC: Siraj, you say last year you started to spend time on energy. What\u2019s interesting to you as it relates to energy? SK: There\u2019s been some improvement in how we capture emissions, but [carbon emissions] are still very deleterious to our health and the planet\u2019s health, and there are a few areas to think about [to address the problem]. Helping people measure and control their consumption is one approach, but also we think about how to produce new energy, which is a shift we [meaning mankind] need to undertake. The challenge [in making that shift] is often [capital expenditures]. It\u2019s hard for venture investors to back companies that are [building nuclear reactors], which makes government grants the best choice for early innovation oftentimes. There is one company, Seaborg, that has figured out a clever reactor. It\u2019s not a portfolio company but it\u2019s [compelling]. SB: We also really like what Seaborg is doing. These [fourth generation] nuclear companies have a whole host of approaches that allow for smaller, safer reactors that you wouldn\u2019t mind having in your backyard. But Siraj put his finger on it: as an early-stage deep tech investor, we have to consider the capital plan of a company, and if it needs to raise billions of dollars, early investors will get really diluted, so early-stage venture just isn\u2019t the best fit. TC: There are other areas you like, though, because costs have fallen so much. SB: Yes. Satellite telephony used to be one of those areas. Some of the satellites in space right now cost $350 million [to launch] and took three to four years to build, which would be really hard for any early-stage investor to fund. But now, a new generation of companies is building satellites for one-tenth of the cost in months, not years. That\u2019s a game changer. They can iterate faster. They can build a better product. They don\u2019t have to raise equity to build and launch either; they can raise from a debt financier [from whom they can] borrow money and pay it back over time. That model isn\u2019t available to a company like Uber or Lyft, because those companies can\u2019t say, \u2018X is going to cost us Y dollars and it will pay back Z over time.\u2019 TC: What of concerns that all these cheap satellites are going to clog up the sky pretty quickly? SB: It\u2019s a real concern. Most [of today\u2019s satellites] are low earth satellites, and the closer to the earth they are, the brighter they are; they reflect the sun more, the more satellites we\u2019re seeing instead of stars. I do think it\u2019s incumbent on all of these companies to think about how they are contributing to the future of humanity. But when you connect the unconnected, educational outcomes improve, health improves, inequality decreases, and the stability of governments improves, so maybe the developed world needs to sacrifice a bit. I think that\u2019s a reasonable tradeoff. If on the other hand, we\u2019re putting up satellites to help people buy more crap . . . TC: It\u2019s like the argument for self-driving cars in a way. Life becomes more efficient, but they\u2019ll require far more energy generation, for example. There are always second-order consequences. SK: But think of how many people are killed in driving accidents, versus terrorist attacks. Humans have many great qualities, but being able to drive a lethal machine consistently isn\u2019t one of them. So when we take that into perspective, it\u2019s really important that we build autonomous vehicles. You [voice] a legitimate concern, and often when there are step changes, there are discontinuities along the way that lead to side effects that aren\u2019t great. That comes down to several things. First, infrastructure will have to keep up. We\u2019ll also have to create regulations that don\u2019t lead to the worst outcomes. One our investments, Lilium in Munich, has built an entirely electric air taxi service that\u2019s built on vertical takeoff. It\u2019s nimble. It\u2019s quiet enough to operate in city environments. On roads, cars are constrained by 2D terrain and buildings, but [in the air] if you can do dynamic air traffic control, it opens up far much efficient transport. If you can get from downtown London to Heathrow [airport] in five minutes versus 50 minutes in a Tesla? That\u2019s far more energy efficient."

            "content": "Adobe CTO Abhay Parasnis sees a shift happening. A shift in how people share content and who wants to use creative tools. A shift in how users expect these tools to work \u2014 especially how much time they take to learn and how quickly they get things done. I spoke with Parasnis in December to learn more about where Adobe\u2019s products are going and how they\u2019ll get there \u2014 even if it means rethinking how it all works today. \u201cWhat could we build that makes today\u2019s Photoshop, or today\u2019s Premiere, or today\u2019s Illustrator look irrelevant five years from now?\u201d he asked. In many cases, that means a lot more artificial intelligence; AI to flatten the learning curve, allowing the user to command apps like Photoshop not only by digging through menus, but by literally telling Photoshop what they want done (as in, with their voice). AI to better understand what the user is doing, helping to eliminate mundane or repetitive tasks. AI to, as Parasnis puts it, \u201cdemocratize\u201d Adobe\u2019s products. We\u2019ve seen some hints of this already. Back in November, Adobe announced Photoshop Camera, a free iOS/Android app that repurposes the Photoshop engine into a lightweight but AI-heavy interface that allows for fancy filters and complex effects with minimal effort or learning required of the user. I see it as Adobe\u2019s way of acknowledging (flexing on?) the Snapchats and Instas of the world, saying \u201coh, don\u2019t worry, we can do that too.\u201d But the efforts to let AI do more and more of the heavy lifting won\u2019t stop with free apps. \u201cWe think AI has the potential to dramatically reduce the learning curve and make people productive \u2014 not at the edges, but 10x, 100x improvement in productivity,\u201d said Parasnis. \u201cThe last decade or two decades of creativity were limited to professionals, people who really were high-end animators, high-end designers\u2026 why isn\u2019t it for every student or every consumer that has a story to tell? They shouldn\u2019t be locked out of these powerful tools only because they\u2019re either costly, or they are more complex to learn. We can democratize that by simplifying the workflow.\u201d"

            "content": "The interesting thing about the technology business is that, most of the time, it\u2019s not the technology that matters. What matters is how people react to it, and what new social norms they form. This is especially true in today\u2019s era, well past the midpoint of the deployment age of smartphones and the internet. People \u2014 smart, thoughtful people, with relevant backgrounds and domain knowledge \u2014 thought that Airbnb and Uber were doomed to failure, because obviously no one would want to stay in a stranger\u2019s home or ride in a stranger\u2019s car. People thought the iPhone would flop, because users would \u201cdetest the touch screen interface.\u201d People thought enterprise software-as-a-service would never fly, because executives would insist on keeping servers in-house at all costs. These people were so, so, so wrong; but note that they weren\u2019t wrong about the technology. (Nobody really argued about the technology.) Instead they were dead wrong about other people, and how their own society and culture would respond to this new stimulus. They were anthropologically incorrect. This, of course, is why every major VC firm, and every large tech company, keeps a crack team of elite anthropologists busy at all times, with big budgets and carte blanche, reporting directly to the leadership team, right? (Looks around.) Oh. Instead they\u2019re doing focus groups and user interviews, asking people in deeply artificial settings to project their usage of an alien technology in an unknown context, and calling that their anthropological, I\u2019m sorry, their market research? Oh. I kid, I kid. Sort of, at least, in that I\u2019m not sure a crack team of elite anthropologists would be all that much more effective. It\u2019s hard enough getting an accurate answer of how a person would use a new technology when that\u2019s the only variable. When they live in a constantly shifting and evolving world of other new technologies, when the ones which take root and spread have a positive-feedback-loop effect on the culture and mindset toward new technologies, and when every one of your first 20 interactions with new tech changes your feelings about it \u2026 it\u2019s basically impossible. And so: painful trial and error, on all sides. Uber and Lyft didn\u2019t think people would happily ride in strangers\u2019 cars either; that\u2019s why Uber started as what is now Uber Black, basically limos-via-app, and Lyft used to have that painfully cringeworthy \u201cride in the front seat, fist-bump your driver\u201d policy. Those are the success stories. The graveyard of companies whose anthropological guesses were too wrong to pivot to rightness, or who couldn\u2019t / wouldn\u2019t do so fast enough, is full to bursting with tombstones. That\u2019s why VCs and Y Combinator have been much more secure businesses than startups; they get to run dozens or hundreds of anthropological experiments in parallel, while startups get to run one, maybe two, three if they\u2019re really fast and flexible, and then they die. This applies to enterprise businesses too, of course. Zoom was an anthropological bet that corporate cultures would make video conferencing big and successful if it actually worked. It\u2019s easy to imagine the mood among CEOs instead being \u201cwe need in-person meetings to encourage those Moments of Serendipity,\u201d which you\u2019ll notice is the same argument that biased so many big companies against remote work and in favor of huge corporate campuses \u2026 an attitude that looks quaint, old-fashioned and outmoded, now. This doesn\u2019t just apply to the deployment phase of technologies. The irruption phase has its own anthropology. But irruption affects smaller sectors of the economy, whose participants are mostly technologists themselves, so it\u2019s more anthropologically reasonable for techies to extrapolate from their own views and project how that society will change. The meta-anthropological theory held by many is that what the highly technical do today, the less technical will do tomorrow. That\u2019s a belief held throughout the tiny, wildly non-representative cryptocurrency community, for instance. But even if it was true once, is it still? Or is a shift away from that pattern to another, larger social change? I don\u2019t know, but I can tell you how we\u2019re going to find out: painful trial and error."

In an op-ed published in today\u2019s Financial Times, Pichai makes a headline-grabbing call for artificial intelligence to be regulated. But his pitch injects a suggestive undercurrent that puffs up the risk for humanity of not letting technologists get on with business as usual and apply AI at population-scale \u2014 with the Google chief claiming: \u201cAI has the potential to improve billions of lives, and the biggest risk may be failing to do so\u201d \u2014 thereby seeking to frame \u2018no hard limits\u2019 as actually the safest option for humanity.

It\u2019s all about managing the level of risk, is the leading suggestion, rather than questioning outright whether the use of a hugely risk-laden technology such as facial recognition should actually be viable in a democratic society. \u201cInternal combustion engines allowed people to travel beyond their own areas but also caused more accidents,\u201d Pichai writes, raiding history for a self-serving example while ignoring the vast climate costs of combustion engines (and the resulting threat now posed to the survival of countless species on Earth). \u201cThe internet made it possible to connect with anyone and get information from anywhere, but also easier for misinformation to spread,\u201d he goes on. \u201cThese lessons teach us that we need to be clear-eyed about what could go wrong.\u201d For \u201cclear-eyed\u201d read: Accepting of the technology-industry\u2019s interpretation of \u2018collateral damage\u2019. (Which, in the case of misinformation and Facebook, appears to run to feeding democracy itself into the ad-targeting meat-grinder.) Meanwhile, not at all mentioned in Pichai\u2019s discussion of AI risks: The concentration of monopoly power that artificial intelligence appears to be very good at supercharging. Funny that. Of course it\u2019s hardly surprising a tech giant that, in recent years, rebranded an entire research division to \u2018Google AI\u2019 \u2014 and has previously been called out by some of its own workforce over a project involving applying AI to military weapons technology \u2014 should be lobbying lawmakers to set AI \u2018limits\u2019 that are as dilute and abstract as possible. The only thing that\u2019s better than zero regulation are laws made by useful idiots who\u2019ve fallen hook, line and sinker for industry-expounded false dichotomies \u2014 such as those claiming it\u2019s \u2018innovation or privacy\u2019. Pichai\u2019s intervention also comes at a strategic moment, with US lawmakers eyeing AI regulation and the White House seemingly throwing itself into alignment with tech giants\u2019 desires for \u2018innovation-friendly\u2019 rules which make their business easier. (To wit: This month White House CTO Michael Kratsios warned in a Bloomberg op-ed against \u201cpreemptive, burdensome or duplicative rules that would needlessly hamper AI innovation and growth\u201d.) The new European Commission, meanwhile, has been sounding a firmer line on both AI and big tech. It has made tech-driven change a key policy priority, with president Ursula von der Leyen making public noises about reining in tech giants. She has also committed to publish \u201ca coordinated European approach on the human and ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence\u201d within her first 100 days in office. (She took up the post on December 1, 2019 so the clock is ticking.) Last week a leaked draft of the Commission proposals for pan-EU AI regulation suggest it\u2019s leaning towards a relatively light touch approach (albeit, the European version of light touch is considerably more involved and interventionist than anything born in a Trump White House, clearly) \u2014 although the paper does float the idea of a temporary ban on the use of facial recognition technology in public places. The paper notes that such a ban would \u201csafeguard the rights of individuals, in particular against any possible abuse of the technology\u201d \u2014 before arguing against such a \u201cfar-reaching measure that might hamper the development and uptake of this technology\u201d, in favor of relying on provisions in existing EU law (such as the EU data protection framework, GDPR), in addition to relevant tweaks to current product safety and liability laws. While it\u2019s not yet clear which way the Commission will jump on regulating AI, even the lightish-touch version its considering would likely be a lot more onerous than Pichai would like. In the op-ed he calls for what he couches as \u201csensible regulation\u201d \u2014 aka taking a \u201cproportionate approach, balancing potential harms, especially in high-risk areas, with social opportunities\u201d. For \u201csocial opportunities\u201d read: The plentiful \u2018business opportunities\u2019 Google is spying \u2014 assuming the hoped for vast additional revenue scale it can get by supercharging expansion of AI-powered services into all sorts of industries and sectors (from health to transportation to everywhere else in between) isn\u2019t derailed by hard legal limits on where AI can actually be applied. \u201cRegulation can provide broad guidance while allowing for tailored implementation in different sectors,\u201d Pichai urges, setting out a preference for enabling \u201cprinciples\u201d and post-application \u201creviews\u201d, to keep the AI spice flowing. The op-ed only touches very briefly on facial recognition \u2014 despite the FT editors choosing to illustrate it with an image of the tech. Here Pichai again seeks to reframe the debate around what is, by nature, an extremely rights-hostile technology \u2014 talking only in passing of \u201cnefarious uses\u201d of facial recognition. Of course this wilfully obfuscates the inherent risks of letting blackbox machines make algorithmic guesses at identity every time a face happens to pass through a public space. You can\u2019t hope to protect people\u2019s privacy in such a scenario. Many other rights are also at risk, depending on what else the technology is being used for. So, really, any use of facial recognition is laden with individual and societal risk. But Pichai is seeking to put blinkers on lawmakers. He doesn\u2019t want them to see inherent risks baked into such a potent and powerful technology \u2014 pushing them towards only a narrow, ill-intended subset of \u201cnefarious\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d AI uses and \u201cconsequences\u201d as being worthy of \u201creal concerns\u201d. And so he returns to banging the drum for \u201ca principled and regulated approach to applying AI\u201d [emphasis ours] \u2014 putting the emphasis on regulation that, above all, gives the green light for AI to be applied. What technologists fear most here is rules that tell them when artificial intelligence absolutely cannot apply. Ethics and principles are, to a degree, mutable concepts \u2014 and ones which the tech giants have become very practiced at claiming as their own, for PR purposes, including by attaching self-styled \u2018guard-rails\u2019 to their own AI operations. (But of course there\u2019s no actual legal binds there.) At the same time data-mining giants like Google are very smooth operators when it comes to gaming existing EU rules around data protection, such as by infesting their user-interfaces with confusing dark patterns that push people to click or swipe their rights away. But a ban on applying certain types of AI would change the rules of the game. Because it would put society in the driving seat. Laws that contained at least a moratorium on certain \u201cdangerous\u201d applications of AI \u2014 such as facial recognition technology, or autonomous weapons like the drone-based system Google was previously working on \u2014 have been called for by some far-sighted regulators. And a ban would be far harder for platform giants to simply bend to their will. So for a while I was willing to buy into the whole tech ethics thing but now I\u2019m fully on the side of tech refusal. We need to be teaching refusal. \u2014 Jonathan Senchyne (@jsench) January 16, 2020"

            "content": "Credit...Video by Robert Rieger At a facility near Berlin, a new kind of robot is automating tasks that until recently had been out of the reach of machines. Credit...Video by Robert Rieger Jan. 29, 2020 LUDWIGSFELDE, Germany \u2014 Inside a warehouse on the outskirts of Berlin, a long line of blue crates moved down a conveyor belt, carrying light switches, sockets and other electrical parts. As they came to a stop, five workers picked through the small items, placing each one in a cardboard box. At Obeta, an electrical parts company that opened in 1901, it is the kind of monotonous task workers have performed for years. But several months ago, a new worker joined the team. Stationed behind protective glass, a robot using three suction cups at the end of its long arm does the same job, sifting through parts with surprising speed and accuracy. While it may not seem like much, this component-sorting robot is a major advance in artificial intelligence and the ability of machines to perform human labor. As millions of products move through warehouses run by Amazon, Walmart and other retailers, low-wage workers must comb through bin after bin of random stuff \u2014 from clothes and shoes to electronic equipment \u2014 so that each item can be packaged and sent on its way. Machines had not really been up to the task, until now. Image Credit...Robert Rieger for The New York Times \u201cI\u2019ve worked in the logistics industry for more than 16 years and I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d said Peter Puchwein, vice president of Knapp, an Austrian company that provides automation technology for warehouses. Standing nearby at the Obeta warehouse, the California engineers who made the robot snapped pictures with their smartphones. They spent more than two years designing the system at a start-up called Covariant.AI, building on their research at the University of California, Berkeley. Their technology is an indication that, in the coming years, few warehouse tasks will be too small or complex for a robot. And as the machines master tasks traditionally handled by humans, their development raises new concerns about warehouse workers losing their jobs to automation. Because the online retail business is growing so quickly \u2014 and most companies will be slow to adopt the latest robotic technologies \u2014 economists believe the advances will not cut into the overall number of logistics jobs anytime soon. But the engineers building these technologies admit that at some point most warehouse tasks will be done by machines. Human workers will need to find other things to do. The engineers at Covariant specialize in a branch of artificial intelligence called reinforcement learning. The machines are wired to learn new tasks on their own through extreme trial and error. And the best place to learn is in the real world. \u201cIf you want to advance artificial intelligence, you don\u2019t just do it in a lab,\u201d said Peter Chen, Covariant\u2019s chief executive and co-founder. \u201cThere is a huge gap in bringing it to the real world.\u201d Video A factory worker working alongside the Covariant robot. Currently, the robot is the only automated station in the packaging hall.CreditCredit...Video by Robert Rieger Warehouses are already highly automated. At the facility outside Berlin, inside a fenced-off room larger than a football field, other robots have long been used to fetch large boxes from shelves several stories high. But that is a relatively easy task for a machine. Engineers can program a robot to perform the same motion over and over again. The boxes are uniform. A robot can pick them up with the same motion every time. Picking through a bin of random items is different. Shapes vary, as do surfaces. One light switch might be upside down, the other right-side up. The next electrical gadget might be in a plastic bag that reflects light in ways a robot has never seen. A human touch has been needed. Programming a robotic arm to deal with every situation, one rule at a time, is impossible. At Knapp, Mr. Puchwein and his partners had tried and failed for years to create a robot with the dexterity and flexibility needed for the job. Image Credit...Robert Rieger for The New York Times Covariant, which is working with Knapp, built software that could learn through trial and error. First, the system learned from a digital simulation of the task \u2014 a virtual recreation of a bin filled with random items. Then, when Mr. Chen and his colleagues transferred this software to a robot, it could pick up items in the real world. The robot could continue to learn as it sorted through items it had never seen before. Inside the German warehouse, the robot can pick and sort more than 10,000 different items, and it does this with more than 99 percent accuracy, according to Covariant. This represents a significant change for the online retail and logistics industries. Late last year, the international robot maker ABB ran a contest. It invited 20 companies to design software for its robot arms that could sort through bins of random items, from cubes to plastic bags filled with other objects. Video Robots on tracks searching for the right tote in the stock to send it to the package station.CreditCredit...Video by Robert Rieger Ten of the companies were based in Europe, and the other half were in the United States. Most came nowhere close to passing the test. A few could handle most tasks but failed on the trickier cases. Covariant was the only company that could handle every task as swiftly and efficiently as a human. \u201cWe were trying to find weaknesses,\u201d said Marc Segura, managing director of service robotics at ABB. \u201cIt is easy to reach a certain level on these tests, but it is super difficult not to show any weaknesses.\u201d Knapp, which helped deploy the system outside Berlin, and ABB believe this technology can be used in similar warehouses. Covariant engineers believe their robots will improve with practice. As a robot in one warehouse learns better ways for picking up certain items, the information feeds back to what is essentially a central brain run by Covariant that will help operate machines. Dirk Jandura, the managing director of Obeta, said companies like his were under extreme pressure to be more efficient. Automation is a key way to keep costs low. Image Credit...Robert Rieger for The New York Times Like many warehouse operators, Obeta has trouble finding workers willing to do the monotonous work. Each picker handles about 170 orders an hour, or about three per minute, over an eight-hour day. In the summer, temperatures in the warehouse reach more than 100 degrees. It is hard to keep employees for longer than six months. For Obeta, the new robot is an ideal solution. A job that requires three humans is done by one tireless robot. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t smoke, is always in good health, isn\u2019t chatting with its neighbors, no toilet breaks,\u201d Mr. Jandura said. \u201cIt\u2019s more efficient.\u201d Knapp is also considering the design of warehouses staffed by robots rather than humans that would allow for packages to be more densely packed into spaces and retrieved by robots trained to perform the task. \u201cThe new warehouses will be built around A.I. robots and not humans,\u201d Mr. Puchwein said. Knapp plans to make it hard for companies to say no to replacing human workers with robots. Mr. Puchwein said they would charge a fee that was always lower than what a company would pay a human. If a company paid $40,000 per year to a worker, Knapp would charge about $30,000, he said. \u201cWe just go lower,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s basically the business model. For the customer, it\u2019s not very hard to decide.\u201d Image Credit...Robert Rieger for The New York Times Beth Gutelius, associate director of the Center for Urban Economic Development at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who has studied the impact of automation on work, said this kind of technology was unlikely to shift the job market any time soon. The greater problem, she said, is that as humans work alongside robots, they will be judged in new ways. \u201cAs we start to compare the speed and efficiency of humans to robots, there is a whole new set of health and safety issues that emerge,\u201d she said. Pieter Abbeel, a Berkeley professor who is a co-founder of Covariant as well as its president and chief scientist, said humans would continue to work alongside machines in these kinds of warehouses. But he acknowledged that the job market would significantly shift as machine learning improved. Image Credit...Robert Rieger for The New York Times \u201cIf this happens 50 years from now, there is plenty of time for the educational system to catch up to the job market,\u201d he said. At the German warehouse, a woman in a baggy T-shirt diligently sorted through the boxes, occasionally looking up at the English-speaking visitors who were taking pictures of the robot and were marveling at its effectiveness. A Covariant engineer walked over to the group to share that the robot had filled more than 200 orders in the past hour, enough to receive a bonus if it were a human. Adam Satariano reported from Ludwigsfelde, and Cade Metz from San Francisco."

            "content": "Hyundai's S-A1 expects to hit production in 2028 to begin supplying Uber for its air taxi service. (Ben Brown/ Fox News) Flying taxis, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and even a new energy drink were among the products that graced the convention floor at this year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show (CES). You can find yourself spending hours walking the seemingly endless halls filled with the latest technology propelling the world into the future. And, while it\u2019s virtually impossible to see everything that CES has to offer, below are just a few items that caught the eye of Fox News. SEGWAY S-POD Instead of standing, the Segway S-Pod takes comfort one step further by allowing the user to sit, shifting their center of gravity for a smooth ride that is eerily reminiscent of the hover chairs in the popular Pixar movie, \u201cWall-E.\u201d The S-Pod can reach up to 24 mph. (Ben Brown / Fox News) \u201cIt is the first-class transporting pod designed for everybody. So, we are envisioning this as part of the future of this smart city,\u201d Jeff Wu, marketing and growth lead at Segway told Fox News. \u201cWe can see it in enclosed campuses, in our shopping malls and the airport, for example.\u201d After the chair finds its center of gravity, the user can glide around up to 24 miles per hour navigating with a simple joystick. The S-pod can travel up to 43 miles on a single charge. Wu said the inspiration behind the design came from the gyro sphere featured in the 2015 \u201cJurassic World\u201d movie starring Chris Pratt, telling Fox News it \u201creally feels like they are flying, levitating when they are navigating\u201d the S-Pod. There is currently no price point set for the S-pod but it will be available for consumers in 2021. \u201cStarting off it will definitely be more of private use in enclosed campuses, but essentially in the future, maybe, you know, for the rideshare pickup, people will be able to use their cell phone to call something like a Segway as part to pick them up to complete a transportation from A to B,\u201d Wu told Fox News, adding that there is more exciting news to come soon. HACHI INFINITE Forget lugging that bulky computer around. The Hachi Infinite can turn any flat surface into a computer. (Ben Brown / Fox News) The Hachi Infinite can turn any flat surface into a fully-interactive touch screen computer, equipped with web-browsing, Microsoft Word and Excel. \u201cIt has built-in Android OS 9.0 \u2026 It's a computer. It works just like a tablet or your phone on any flat surface,\u201d Hannah Wilkinson, marketing for Hachi told Fox News. \u201cYou can use Microsoft Word, you can use YouTube, you can search the Internet, you can play Candy Crush, you can do anything on this -- anything you could do on a computer or your phone.\u201d It essentially looks like a portable mini projector and has brightness sensors so it can be used indoors and outdoors, even on a sunny day. In addition to functioning like a computer, the device can flip on its other side to be used as the ultimate movie viewing experience with a 120 inch HD display and an ultra-short throw DLP built-in,\u201d Wilkinson said. The Hachi Infinite also has built-in artificial intelligence capabilities, including the ability to identify foods and offer up unique dinner recipes centered around that identified item. \u201cThere's already three A.I. functionalities built right into it -- So, it can recognize objects and uses deep learning algorithms. There's a variety of learning experiences for children, cooking experiences -- it can recognize any kind of fruit or vegetable in front of it and tell you the nutritional information, tell you recipes you can use with it,\u201d Wilkinson said, adding that \u201cHachi is developing a number of apps that work with A.I. functionalities.\u201d COKE ENERGY An energy drink that tastes like your favorite soda \u2026 no wonder it made it onto the CES floor. Coca-Cola Energy hits shelves on January 20th. (Ben Brown / Fox News) Coca-Cola is trying to shake-up the buzzing energy drink market with its own tasty concoction. No longer does one have to choose between an energy drink or a soda to provide that much-needed caffeine boost throughout the day, because Coca-Cola has come up with the solution \u2013 Coca-Cola Energy. \u201cCoca-Cola has always looked at a consumer-focused approach to innovation, and as we learned about consumers and what they were looking for in the US, we learned that they love Coca-Cola. They love the uplift of Coke,\u201d Jaideep Kibe, vice president for Coca-Cola trademark in the United States told Fox News. \u201cBut there are moments in their day when they want that extra boost, but they want it in a way that's familiar and approachable -- and that's how Coke Energy was born.\u201d The new beverage unveiled at this year\u2019s CES comes in four flavors: Coca-Cola Energy, Coca-Cola Energy Zero, Coca-Cola Energy Cherry and Coca-Cola Energy Cherry Zero. A regular Coke is about 34 grams of caffeine, but the recipe for this [Coca-Cola Energy} is like that of an energy drink. So it does have 114 grams of caffeine. It has Guarana and it has B vitamins,\u201d Kibe said. \u201cSo, it's comparable to all the leading energy drinks, but it has the familiar and approachable taste of Coca-Cola, which people know and love.\u201d Coke partnered with Amazon\u2019s Alexa to create an interactive booth that allowed CES attendees to get some of the first sips of the new energy drink that is set to hit the market on January 20th. \u201cCoca-Cola has always been at the forefront of innovation. Our choices have always been driven not by ourselves, but by what our consumers were looking for,\u201d Kibe said. \u201cAnd when you look at the energy category around the world, and most especially in the U.S., there's a lot of growth, there's a lot of need thanks to our modern-day lifestyles for that extra boost and an extra kick.\u201d CYBERSHOES While companies have made great strides in virtual reality gaming, there are limitations to how truly \u201cinteractive\u201d the experience can be when you\u2019re confined certain amount of space \u2013 whether you\u2019re playing inside an apartment or at an arcade. Cybershoes allows users to run and walk-in virtual reality games. (Ben Brown / Fox News) Cybershoes might just be the first step into figuring out a solution to adding another layer into immersing the user into the game. For about $360 gamers can purchase the Cybershoes Gaming Station, which includes the shoes along with a cyberchair and cybercarpet. The Cybershoes strap on over your normal footwear and have a wheel attached to the bottom allowing the user to sit in the cyberchair and mimic walking/running while remaining sit. The motions then translate into the game and voila! no more stationary gaming \u2013 and it is actually quite the workout! HYUNDAI S-A1 FLYING TAXI Traffic jams and flat tires might soon be a thing of the past, as Hyundai and Uber Elevate are teaming up to offer a new way to travel. Hyundai unveiled its full-scale concept Urban Mobility Vehicle dubbed the S-A1, which essentially looks like a souped-up helicopter that Uber will use for its flying taxi service. \u201cThis is a game-changer for the aerospace industry because historically production rates have been fairly low in aviation. When you bring the capabilities of an automaker to this sector, it creates an opportunity for scale as it relates to the production and that can make sure that technology gets in the hands of more people around the world,\u201d Wyatt Smith, head of business development of Uber Elevate told Fox News. Uber Air would work similarly to how Uber operates now \u2013 with a push of a button a car would pick you up and take you to a Skyport where an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicle is waiting to fly you to the next hub most proximate to your destination. The passenger will then hop in another car that will take them the rest of the way. The S-A1 would just be one component of the urban air mobility ecosystem connecting the whole network together to allow passengers to get from point A to B. While this might all sound farfetched and lightyears away, both Hyundai and Uber expect the next form of consumer transportation to hit the market within the next decade. TRUMEDIC\u2019S $5,500 MASSAGE CHAIR TruMedic\u2019s InstaShiatsu+ Massage Chairs can be found in celebrity homes like the Kardashians, but it'll cost you a pretty penny. TruMedic\u2019s InstaShiatsu+ Massage Chairs range in price from a few hundred dollars up to $5,500. (Ben Brown / Fox News) If you have a few thousand dollars and want to be pampered like a celebrity, the full-body massage chair will do the trick \u2013 from your arms to your waist to your neck and shoulders, this chair does it all. However, there are less expensive options that don't come with as many bells and whistles. Prices range from as low as $400 to as high as $5,500. In addition to the massage chairs, truMedic offers a cheaper but just as effective option dubbed the MagicHands truShiatsu Neck and Back Massager which has deep-kneading massage nodes that act like a human \u201cthumb\u201d to help penetrate sore muscles or offer an effective pre-workout warmup. The Magichands retail for $299.95 and is a favorite among celebrities like Hailey Bieber, Lily Aldridge, Joan Smalls, Winnie Harlow. MagicHands truShiatsu Neck and Back was selected for Oprah\u2019s Favorite Things in December 2019. (Ben Brown / Fox News) MagicHands was also selected for Oprah\u2019s Favorite Things in December 2019. \"We\u2019re pioneering the category of \u2018Intelligent Wellness,\u2019 and in doing so, truMedic is creating a world beyond relief,\u201d Russell Izzo, truMedic CEO said. \u201cWith our newest innovations, consumers will experience amazing new designs with cutting edge form and functionality that deliver ultimate relaxation and recovery in the comfort of their homes and on-the-go. We spent years delighting customers with our quality and commitment to this category and we are excited to be leading its evolution into the next decade.\u201d"

These new export rules \u2014 for companies building artificial intelligence software for analyzing satellite imagery \u2014 are targeting emerging technology that could give the U.S. a significant military or intelligence advantage. A special license would be required to sell software outside the U.S. that could scan aerial images automatically to identify objects of interest, such as vehicles or houses. U.S. WILL DOUBLE EXPORTS TO CHINA UNDER 'PHASE ONE' DEAL: LIGHTHIZER The rules could affect a growing sector of the technology industry using algorithms to analyze satellite images of crops, trade patterns and other changes affecting the economy or environment.

(Credit: FlyEM/Janelia Research Campus) Scientists have created the most detailed 3D map of an organism brain to date. The mesmerizing threads of blue, yellow, purple and green represent thousands of brain cells and millions of connections found inside the brain of a fruit fly. This high-resolution map, known as a \"connectome,\" only makes up one-third of a fruit fly's brain but includes a large region involved in learning, navigation, smell and vision. Scientists found over 4,000 different types of neurons, including those involved in the fly's circadian rhythm \u2014 or internal clock \u2014 that might help researchers learn a bit more about how the insect sleeps, according to the publicly released data. This map, a collaboration between scientists at Google and the Janelia Research Campus in Virginia, took two years to create. The team started out by cutting a fruit fly brain into extremely thin slices using a hot knife \u2014 and then imaging each slice under an electron microscope. Afterward, they stitched the images together to create a large map, tracing the paths of the neurons through the brain, according to the statement. Related: 3D Images: Exploring the Human Brain The point of such maps is to reveal something about how specific physical connections in the brain are linked to distinct behaviors. But following each individual neuron in a journey across the brain is painstaking work \u2014 and critics note that such maps have not yet led to a major discovery, according to The Verge. The only organism to have its entire brain mapped this way is the roundworm C. elegans \u2014 a wriggly critter that only harbors around 300 to 400 neurons and around 7,000 synapses, or the junctions between brain cells. Other teams have attempted to map the human brain in lower resolution. But considering that the human brain contains 86 billion neurons, creating such a map will likely take some more time. The new map was published on Jan. 21 in the database BioRxiv, and it has not yet been peer reviewed.

            "content": "By , Kris Osborn Published January 06, 2020 File photo - A 10th Mountain Division Soldier fires an M4 rifle during a platoon Situational Training Exercise at a range in Arta, Djibouti, Aug. 25, 2018. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Haley D. Phillips) Targets emerge in seconds, incoming enemy fire puts lives at risk and shifting combat dynamics require immediate, on-the-spot decisions in a matter of seconds -- all as soldiers navigate the complex web of threats during all-out, high-risk ground-warfare. These kinds of predicaments, which characterize much of what soldiers train to face, are immeasurably improved by emerging applications of AI; artificial intelligence can already gather, fuse, organize and analyze otherwise disparate pools of combat-sensitive data for individual soldiers. Target information from night vision sensors, weapons sights, navigational devices and enemy fire detection systems can increasingly be gathered and organized for individual human soldier decision-makers. However, what comes after this? Where will AI go next in terms of changing modern warfare for Army infantry on the move in war? The Army Research Laboratory is now immersed in a complex new series of research and experimentation initiatives to explore a \u201cnext-level\u201d of AI. Fundamentally, this means not only using advanced algorithms to ease the cognitive burden for individual soldiers -- but also network and integrate otherwise stovepiped applications of AI systems. In effect, this could be described as performing AI-enabled analytics on groups of AI systems themselves. \u201cAutonomy is doing things in a snipped way that can be connected. We can benefit from an overarching AI approach, something that looks at the entire mission. Right now our autonomy solves very discreet problems that are getting more complicated,\u201d J. Corde Lane, Ph.D., director, Human Research and Engineering, CCDC-Army Research Laboratory, told Warrior in an interview. F-35 SET FOR LASER BOOST What does this mean? In essence, it translates into a way combat commanders will not only receive AI-generated input from individual soldiers but also be able to assess how different AI systems can themselves be compared to one another and analyzed as a dynamic group. For instance, Lane explained, perhaps multiple soldier-centric AI-empowered assessments can be collected and analyzed in relation to one another with a mind to how they impact a broader, squad-level combat dynamic. In particular, simultaneous analysis of multiple soldier-oriented AI system can help determine the best course of action for an entire unit, in relation to an overall mission objective. \u201cWhat is the entire mission and possible courses of action? Do we optimize the logistics flow? Find targets as the dynamic battlefield gets more complex? The Commander can draw upon advanced AI to explore new options,\u201d Lane explained. Therefore, in addition to drawing upon algorithms able to organize data within a given individual system, future AI will encompass using real-time analytics to assess multiple systems simultaneously and how they impact one another to offer an overall integrated view. All of this progress, just as is the case now, will still rely heavily upon human decision-making faculties to optimize its added value for combat. Integrating a collective picture, drawing upon a greater range of variables will require soldiers to incorporate new tactics and methods of analysis to best leverage the additional available information. SOLDIERS USE AI TO FIRE PRECISION GRENADES, GUIDE DRONE ATTACKS \u201cWhen we have new and improved autonomy coming in, soldiers need to know how to use that. How do you keep the soldier always at the center and adapt to them as you adapt to the new AI?\u201d Lane asked. Perhaps one soldier receives organized sensor-driven targeting data relevant to a specific swath of terrain, while another AI system is organizing variables to determine the supply flow of ammunition, fuel or other logistical factors. \u201cData never seen cannot be learned. It is not about AI, but combining AI with a soldier who has the concept of an entire mission. AI provides information and then they get put together. When you are under fire, you are going to need different types of information,\u201d Lane explained. For example, comparing and analyzing various AI systems to help engender a collective picture of some kind might enable a commander to know \u201cif you go this way you will use more fuel but it will be safer,\u201d as Lane explained. HOW AI CHANGES ATTACK MISSIONS FOR US FIGHTER JETS AND BOMBERS Interestingly, Lane\u2019s point about the irreplaceable characteristics of human cognition in the face of new AI-driven technologies is anticipated in a 2017 essay from the Chatham House Royal Institute of International Affairs, called \u201cArtificial Intelligence and the Future of War.\u201d The essay, written by M.L. Cummings, states that \u201creplicating the intangible concept of intuition, knowledge-based reasoning and true expertise is, for now, beyond the realm of computers.\u201d Mathematically oriented computer algorithms naturally face limitations when it comes to things like judgments, feelings or quickly assessing not-yet-seen information; an AI-database can only be as effective as the information it already has stored in its database. While Machine-Learning techniques continue to accelerate the pace at which an existing AI database can quickly integrate and perform analytics on new information, AI-infused computing can only make decisions or solve problems in relation to the information it already has stored. Now it goes without saying that these databases are increasingly vast, almost seeming limitless, yet they do need to consistently be fed with not-yet-stored information of great relevance to wartime decisions. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Chatham House essay puts it this way: \u201cEvery autonomous system that interacts in a dynamic environment must construct a world model and continually update that model. This means that the world must be perceived (or sensed through cameras, microphones and/or tactile sensors) and then reconstructed in such a way that the computer \u2018brain\u2019 has an effective and updated model of the world it is in before it can make decisions. The fidelity of the world model and the timeliness of its updates are the keys to an effective autonomous system.\u201d (Artificial Intelligence and the Future of War\u201d M.L.

            "content": "Apple dropped $200 million this week on a company that makes lightweight artificial intelligence. It\u2019s all about keeping an edge in AI ... by adding more AI to the edge. The acquisition of Xnor.ai, a Seattle startup working on low-power machine learning software and hardware, points to a key AI battleground for Apple and other tech heavyweights\u2014packing ever-more intelligence into smartphones, smartwatches, and other smart devices that do computing on the \u201cedge\u201d rather that in the cloud. And doing it without killing your battery. \u201cMachine learning is going to happen at the edge in a big way,\u201d predicts Subhasish Mitra, a professor at Stanford who is working on low-power chips for AI. \u201cThe big question is how do you do it efficiently? That requires new hardware technology and design. And, at the same time, new algorithms as well.\u201d The most powerful AI algorithms tend to be large and very power hungry when run on general purpose chips. But a growing number of startups, Xnor.ai among them, have begun devising ways to pare down AI models and run them on extremely energy-efficient, highly specialized hardware. Last March, Xnor.ai demoed a computer chip capable of running image recognition using only the power from a solar cell. A research paper authored by the founders of Xnor.ai and posted online in 2016 describes a more efficient form of convolutional neural network, a machine learning tool that is particularly well suited to visual tasks. The researchers reduced the size of the network by essentially creating a simplified approximation of the interplay among its layers. Apple already makes chips that perform certain AI tasks, like recognizing the wake phrase \u201cHey, Siri.\u201d But its hardware will need to become more capable without draining your battery. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. Now, AI on the edge means running pretrained models that do a specific task, such as recognizing a face in a video or a voice in a call. But Mitra says it may not be long before we see edge devices that learn too. This could let a smartphone or another device improve its performance over time, without sending anything to the cloud. \u201cThat would be truly exciting,\u201d he says. \u201cToday most devices are essentially dumb.\u201d Applying AI to video more efficiently, as Xnor.ai has demoed, will also be key for Apple, Google, and anyone working in mobile computing. Cameras and related software are a key selling point for iPhones and other smartphones, and video-heavy apps like TikTok are popular among younger smartphone customers. Edge computing has the added benefit of keeping personal data on your device, instead of sending it to the cloud. Dave Schubmehl, an analyst with the research firm IDC, says machine learning could also be used in Apple gadgets that currently don't include AI. \"I can see them running AI on the Apple Watch and in AirPods, to clean up sound for example,\" he says. \"There's tremendous opportunity in existing products.\" Running sophisticated AI on video, like an algorithm that can tell what\u2019s happening in a scene or add complex special effects, is usually done in the cloud because it requires a significant amount of computer power. \u201cFor example, adding synthetic depth of field to your photos might require running a deep network to estimate the depth of each pixel,\u201d says James Hays, a professor at Georgia Tech who specializes in computer vision. Besides making your iPhone\u2019s camera smarter, Xnor.ai\u2019s technology could help Apple in other areas. Giving machines more ability to perceive and understand the messy real world will be key to robotics, autonomous driving, and natural language understanding. \u201cIf the goal of AI is to achieve human-level intelligence, reasoning about images is vital to that,\u201d Hays says, noting that roughly a third of the human brain is dedicated to visual processing. \u201cEvolution seems to consider vision vital to intelligence,\u201d he says. Apple seems to think that a more evolved form of computer vision is pretty valuable too.

            "content": "AP Photo/Charles Krupa The MIT Technology Review reported in 2018 that Amazon Alexa home assistant devices may actually be listening in on people\u2019s daily lives even when not given commands. Despite such warnings, the e-commerce giant sold out of Alexa-powered devices before Christmas as their popularity continues to grow unabated. The MIT Technology Review reported in an article titled \u201cYes, Alexa is recording mundane details of your life, and it\u2019s creepy as hell,\u201d that Amazon Alexa home assistant devices are listening in on people\u2019s conversations, a theory that has been around for some time but has never been confirmed. The MIT Technology Review reports: Beyond all the things I\u2019ve clearly asked Alexa to do, in the past several months it has also tuned in, frequently several times a day, for no obvious reason. It\u2019s heard me complain to my dad about something work-related, chide my toddler about eating dinner, and talk to my husband\u2014the kinds of normal, everyday things you say at home when you think no one else is listening. And that\u2019s precisely why it\u2019s terrifying: this sort of mundane chitchat is my mundane chitchat. I invited Alexa into our living room to make it easier to listen to Pandora and occasionally check the weather, not to keep a log of intimate family details or record my kid saying \u201cMommy, we going car\u201d and forward it to Amazon\u2019s cloud storage. The MIT Technology Review notes that constant recording is one of the unfortunate downsides of home assistants that constantly listen for wake words such as \u201cAlexa!\u201d or \u201cHey, Siri!\u201d Through 2019, Amazon faced continual bad news about its Alexa-powered devices on the subject of user privacy and security. Reports were published showing that Amazon employees and contractors located in India, Costa Rica, and Romania had ready access to users\u2019 recordings and spent nine hours a day listening to the snippets. The work is mostly mundane. One worker in Boston said he mined accumulated voice data for specific utterances such as \u201cTaylor Swift\u201d and annotated them to indicate the searcher meant the musical artist. Occasionally the listeners pick up things Echo owners likely would rather stay private: a woman singing badly off key in the shower, say, or a child screaming for help. The teams use internal chat rooms to share files when they need help parsing a muddled word\u2014or come across an amusing recording. This revelation led to a lawsuit against Amazon which claimed that Jeff Bezos\u2019 Big Tech giant was breaking the law by recording children without their parent\u2019s consent. In another threat to security, researchers in Tokyo documented that Amazon\u2019s voice assistant hardware could be hacked with a $5 laser pointer. Despite the negativity about Amazon\u2019s devices recording users when they don\u2019t expect it, sales of Alexa-powered devices have continued to rise. Early in 2019, Amazon announced that it had sold 100 million Alexa devices. Sales haven\u2019t slowed down since then. Although the company has not released Christmas sales figures, for the third quarter of 2019, it sold more than 10 million devices and enjoys a 36 percent share of the market. It\u2019s next closest competitor, the Chinese company Alibaba, has a 13 percent market share. Breitbart News has previously published a guide explaining how to stop Amazon employees from having access to Alexa recordings, however, this does not stop the device from recording users\u2019 daily interactions but rather protects them from being listened to by Amazon employees directly.

            "content": "According to a recent report by Wired, a Canadian AI-driven algorithm called BlueDot sent the first warnings of the coronavirus outbreak in China beating both the CDC and the WHO. Wired reports that on January 6, the CDC issued a warning about a possible virus outbreak in China, the WHO made a similar announcement on January 9 after a number of pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan. But both were beaten to the report by a Canadian AI health monitoring platform called BlueDot which sent warnings to customers on December 31, 2019. BlueDot uses an AI-driven algorithm to search through foreign-language news reports, animal and plant disease networks, and official statements from government bodies in order to warn its clients of danger zones such as Wuhan which has become the center of the coronavirus outbreak in China. Public health officials at the WHO and CDC are forced to rely on reports from Chinese officials \u2014 who are often not very forthcoming with information \u2014 but BlueDot relies on artificial intelligence that may prove faster than official statements. Kamran Khan, BlueDot\u2019s founder and CEO, commented on the algorithm stating: \u201cWe know that governments may not be relied upon to provide information in a timely fashion. We can pick up news of possible outbreaks, little murmurs or forums or blogs of indications of some kind of unusual events going on.\u201d Khan worked as a hospital infectious disease specialist in Toronto during the SARS epidemic of 2003 and commented on the current coronavirus situation stating: \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of deja vu right now. In 2003, I watched the virus overwhelm the city and cripple the hospital. There was an enormous amount of mental and physical fatigue, and I thought, \u2018Let\u2019s not do this again.\u2019\u201d Khan launched BlueDot in 2014 and raised $9.4 million in venture capital funding, the firm now employees 40 people including physicians and programmers who have worked to develop the disease surveillance analytic program that uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to sort through news reports in 65 languages as well as airline data and animal disease outbreak reports. \u201cWhat we have done is use natural language processing and machine learning to train this engine to recognize whether this is an outbreak of anthrax in Mongolia versus a reunion of the heavy metal band Anthrax,\u201d Kahn says.

            "content": "The New York Times published an investigation recently into a little-known startup that helps law enforcement match photos of unknown people to their online images using facial recognition, and the privacy issues that are raised by the company and its massive database of photos. The New York Times writes in an article titled \u201cThe Secretive Company That Might End Privacy as We Know It\u201d that a new tech startup that has been working with law enforcement could raise serious privacy issues for members of the public. Clearview AI, a facial recognition tech startup, has developed a system that allows users to upload a photo of a person to the app and see public photos of that person, along with links to where those photos appeared. The system scrapes information from Facebook, YouTube, Venmo and millions of other websites to help law enforcement track down individuals. The New York Times writes: Federal and state law enforcement officers said that while they had only limited knowledge of how Clearview works and who is behind it, they had used its app to help solve shoplifting, identity theft, credit card fraud, murder and child sexual exploitation cases. Until now, technology that readily identifies everyone based on his or her face has been taboo because of its radical erosion of privacy. Tech companies capable of releasing such a tool have refrained from doing so; in 2011, Google\u2019s chairman at the time said it was the one technology the company had held back because it could be used \u201cin a very bad way.\u201d Some large cities, including San Francisco, have barred police from using facial recognition technology. The technology is reportedly being used by multiple law enforcement agencies amongst other groups, but many security experts have warned that the technology could easily be weaponized: \u201cThe weaponization possibilities of this are endless,\u201d said Eric Goldman, co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University. \u201cImagine a rogue law enforcement officer who wants to stalk potential romantic partners, or a foreign government using this to dig up secrets about people to blackmail them or throw them in jail.\u201d The New York Times also notes that while investigating Clearview and finding little accurate public information about the company, Clearview began to investigate the Times reporter looking into the company: While the company was dodging me, it was also monitoring me. At my request, a number of police officers had run my photo through the Clearview app. They soon received phone calls from company representatives asking if they were talking to the media \u2014 a sign that Clearview has the ability and, in this case, the appetite to monitor whom law enforcement is searching for. Facial recognition technology has always been controversial. It makes people nervous about Big Brother. It has a tendency to deliver false matches for certain groups, like people of color. And some facial recognition products used by the police \u2014 including Clearview\u2019s \u2014 haven\u2019t been vetted by independent experts.

            "content": "More left-wing journalists are waking up to the fact that unaccountable Silicon Valley corporations are ranking Americans with a system that bears a growing resemblance to China\u2019s totalitarian \u201csocial credit\u201d system \u2014 almost a year after Breitbart Tech pointed out the same thing. China\u2019s \u201csocial credit\u201d system assigns citizens with a \u201cscore\u201d based on good or bad behavior, which is in part determined by one\u2019s compliance with Beijing\u2019s totalitarian communist value system. Those who fall below a certain score are excluded from basic services. There\u2019s no escape, either; to track everyone\u2019s behavior, China subjects its citizens to mass surveillance, powered by a network of facial recognition cameras all across the country. Chinese citizens literally can\u2019t escape their social credit score \u2014 low scores blocked 23 million Chinese citizens from traveling via train or airplane in less than one year, as reported by the Guardian. In an article for Engadget, left-wing writer Violet Blue notes that big tech companies have developed a system that is remarkably similar to China\u2019s, ranking the behavior of users \u2014 and arbitrarily kicking them off their services \u2014 according to Silicon Valley\u2019s own set of subjective values, including what it considers to be \u201cconscientious\u201d and \u201copen\u201d behavior. She takes particular aim at Airbnb: The Evening Standard reported on Airbnb\u2019s patent for AI that crawls and scrapes everything it can find on you, \u201cincluding social media for traits such as \u2018conscientiousness and openness\u2019 against the usual credit and identity checks and what it describes as \u2018secure third-party databases\u2019.\u201d Blue makes the connection to China, where similarly invasive surveillance is used to build a profile and a social credit score on every citizen: The most famous social credit system in operation is that used by China\u2019s government. It \u201cmonitors millions of individuals\u2019 behavior (including social media and online shopping), determines how moral or immoral it is, and raises or lowers their \u201ccitizen score\u201d accordingly,\u201d reported Atlantic in 2018. \u2026 Trooly \u2014 nee Airbnb \u2014 is combining social credit scores with predictive policing. Tools like PredPol use AI that combines data points and historical events, factors like race and location, digital footprints and crime statistics, to predict likelihood of when and where crimes will occur (as well as victims and perpetrators). It\u2019s no secret that predictive policing replicates and perpetuates discrimination. Last August, Fast Company made the same observation, pointing out that Silicon Valley\u2019s combination of invasive surveillance with arbitrary user policies meant that \u201ca parallel system\u201d to China\u2019s is being created in the United States. Breitbart News had, of course, made the connections months before they had. It\u2019s almost as if conservatives were the first to feel the effects of big tech censorship! Blue is upset because the same methods that have been used to monitor and blacklist conservatives and right-wingers (many of whom have been kicked off Airbnb for political reasons) are now being used to ban prostitutes, a profession championed by the intersectional left. Combine this with companies like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and yes, Airbnb deciding what legal behaviors are acceptable for service, and now we\u2019re looking at groups of historically marginalized people being denied involvement in mainstream economic, political, cultural and social activities \u2014 at scale. This week AP reported that Facebook and Instagram are doing exactly that. \u201cActivists, sex therapists, abuse survivors, artists and sex educators,\u201d are being unfairly censored by both services. \u201cAnd it\u2019s no small matter for them. Artists can be suddenly left without their audience, businesses without access to their customers and vulnerable people without a support network \u2026 it means that a company in Silicon Valley, whose online platforms have become not only our town squares but diaries, magazines, art galleries and protest platforms, gets final say on matters of free speech and self-expression.\u201d Silicon Valley companies getting the final say on matters of free speech? Woah! Sound the alarms! Social media companies as the new town squares? That might be a groundbreaking argument, if PragerU hadn\u2019t already made it three years ago. Unaccountable corporations, using their power to circumvent the democratic system and ban otherwise legal behavior? It\u2019s only something Breitbart Tech has been talking about for one, two, three, let\u2019s say four years at a conservative estimate. Given that Violet Blue takes issue with tech companies \u201cdeciding what legal behaviors are acceptable for service,\u201d this means she will surely get behind political efforts to force social media companies to be strictly value-neutral in their approach to content. You know, like Rep. Louie Gohmert\u2019s and Rep. Paul Gosar\u2019s and Sen. Josh Hawley\u2019s. It\u2019s only a matter of time, right?

            "content": "JOSH EDELSON/Getty According to a recent report, the Masters of the Universe in Silicon Valley have plans to further expand into the world of finance in the new year \u2014 falling just short of opening their own banks. A recent report from CNBC claims that Silicon Valley tech giants are likely to expand their business into the world of finance even further in 2020, but many want to avoid the hassle of becoming a fully-fledged bank. With Facebook announcing its own cryptocurrency, Googles plans to introduce consumer bank accounts in collaboration with Citibank, and Apple\u2019s new credit card in partnership with Goldman Sachs, finance seems to be a major focus for tech firms. CNBC writes: Though their products are different, both firms share something in common: they have no plans to become regulated financial institutions like Citi or Goldman. While Big Tech \u2014 a group of companies that includes Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple \u2014 will undoubtedly push deeper into finance this year, their progress in banking will be \u201cmore of a slow creep than big strides,\u201d said Sarah Kocianski, head of research at fintech consultancy 11:FS. \u201cThe big tech firms will continue to add services that are peripheral to banking to their existing offerings, without going full-stack banking,\u201d she said. \u201cThe headache of getting, and maintaining, a banking license would likely be considered too big a risk for these companies. Instead, they will continue to operate with licensed partners.\u201d But, Accenture\u2019s global payments lead, Sulabh Agarwal stated when asked that it makes little sense for tech firms to become banks. \u201cDo I expect them to become banks? I don\u2019t think so do. I expect them to create new services to enhance their propositions,\u201d Argawal stated. Facebook is making moves on two fronts in the world of finance, with its digital currency Libra and with its payment processing platform Facebook Pay. CNBC writes: \u201cThe theory goes that if 2 billion people were to withdraw their deposits from the banking system and move them into Libra tokens, you\u2019d effectively have a run on the banks,\u201d said Simon Taylor, co-founder and blockchain lead at 11:FS. \u201cFacebook is absolutely big enough for that to be plausible, but whether or not it happens depends much more on what consumer problem is being solved.\u201d Aside from libra, Facebook is also consolidating its payment products under a new brand called Facebook Pay. Uber, like its Southeast Asian competitor Grab, is moving further into finance with a division called Uber Money that houses a digital wallet and upgraded payment cards. They\u2019ll face competition from the likes of Google Pay and Apple Pay in the U.S. and Chinese payment apps like Alipay and WeChat Pay. E-commerce giant Amazon is already in the process of lending out money but has yet to break into consumer banking. It should be noted that Amazon at one point set up a student loan scheme in 2016 with Wells Fargo which shut down shortly afterward. Sarah Kocianski, head of research at fintech consultancy 11:FS, stated that there was \u201cevery reason to suspect they\u2019ve learned from that.\u201d Read the full report at CNBC here.
