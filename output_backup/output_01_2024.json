            "content": "A new kind of Industrial Revolution could already be well underway into a sustained state, defying more typical formations of cyclical boom and bust periods in tech. Meanwhile, AI continues to be ascendant \u2013 or at least the current version of neural networks trained on large data sets that drives developments like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude. One topic keeps coming up in conversations I\u2019m having with technologists, executives, industry leader and frontline workers on all sides of both trends: Specifically, how much the AI boom is complicit in the great and continued culling. Everyone seems to agree that the advent and uptake of AI is playing some part in at least the scope of the layoffs, if not in the timing, which more likely is attributable to overall economic uncertainty. Companies are certainly crowing about the benefits in efficiency new AI products can and are bringing to businesses, but few actually mention them in the specific context of layoffs \u2013 though news about AI replacing at least some of those losing their jobs is making its way out despite efforts to keep that under wraps. Salesforce is laying off around 700 people in its most recent tranche of job cuts, which adds to the group it announced it was cutting last year. SAP, too, announced a massive restructuring but stressed that it anticipates headcount will be the same by end of year. That\u2019s a lot of massaging of the message, but the real story is that these massive companies would typically grow year-over-year, so even flat hiring with restructuring, some buy-outs and backfill hires is a step back from business-as-usual. Both these companies, and many of the other massive tech firms currently suffering through layoffs have also signalled and/or announced sizeable investments in AI to help augment or replace work currently being done by people. Typically these announcements are accompanied by assurances that automating certain tasks will lead to actual human resources being deployed in roles and for jobs that are much more fulfilling, creative and meaningful. Long-term, that may be the case, but right now it\u2019s all \u2018regrettable\u2019 downsizing alongside massive, budget-busting spend on AI products and innovation, with no silver lining in sight about when those generate whole new roles and opportunities for those workers displaced in the meantime. There are plenty of comforting examples out there of how generative AI is still lacking in many regards when it comes to comparing them with actual people \u2013 but there are just as many, if not more, examples of how people are happily using tools like ChatGPT for their real work everyday, with results that are at least satisfactory, if not better than what they were able to do before. Technology revolutions are always disruptive and displace tons of people, but this one seems unique in that the technology it promises doesn\u2019t just augment human efficiency in specific roles in all cases \u2013 it actively replaces an entire function in many. There\u2019s a need for greater transparency about when AI will occupy roles people once did as these large companies continue their roll-out, but we\u2019re unlikely to get that in the midst of the action: More likely it\u2019ll be studied and uncovered later by researchers trying to assess the impact."

            "content": "Will AI automate human jobs, and \u2014 if so \u2014 which jobs and when? That\u2019s the trio of questions a new research study from MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), out this morning, tries to answer. There\u2019s been many attempts to extrapolate out and project how the AI technologies of today, like large language models, might impact people\u2019s\u2019 livelihoods \u2014 and whole economies \u2014 in the future. Goldman Sachs estimates that AI could automate 25% of the entire labor market in the next few years. According to McKinsey, nearly half of all work will be AI-driven by 2055. A survey from the University of Pennsylvania, NYU and Princeton finds that ChatGPT alone could impact around 80% of jobs. And a report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas suggests that AI is already replacing thousands of workers. But in their study, the MIT researchers sought to move beyond what they characterize as \u201ctask-based\u201d comparisons and assess how feasible it is that AI will perform certain roles \u2014 and how likely businesses are to actually replace workers with AI tech. Contrary to what one (including this reporter) might expect, the MIT researchers found that the majority of jobs previously identified as being at risk of AI displacement aren\u2019t, in fact, \u201ceconomically beneficial\u201d to automate \u2014 at least at present. The key takeaway, says Neil Thompson, a research scientist at MIT CSAIL and a co-author on the study, is that the coming AI disruption might happen slower \u2014 and less dramatically \u2014 than some commentators are suggesting. \u201cLike much of the recent research, we find significant potential for AI to automate tasks,\u201d Thompson told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cBut we\u2019re able to show that many of these tasks are not yet attractive to automate.\u201d Now, in an important caveat, the study only looked at jobs requiring visual analysis \u2014 that is, jobs involving tasks like inspecting products for quality at the end of a manufacturing line. The researchers didn\u2019t investigate the potential impact of text- and image-generating models, like ChatGPT and Midjourney, on workers and the economy; they leave that to follow-up studies. In conducting this study, the researchers surveyed workers to understand what an AI system would have to accomplish, task-wise, to fully replace their jobs. They then modeled the cost of building an AI system capable of doing all this, and also modeled whether businesses \u2014 specifically \u201cnon-farm\u201d U.S.-based businesses \u2014 would be willing to pay both the upfront and operating expenses for such a system. Early in the study, the researchers give the example of a baker. A baker spends about 6% of their time checking food quality, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2014 a task that could be (and is being) automated by AI. A bakery employing five bakers making $48,000 per year could save $14,000 were it to automate food quality checks. But by the study\u2019s estimates, a bare-bones, from-scratch AI system up to the task would cost $165,000 to deploy and $122,840 per year to maintenance\u2026 on the low end. \u201cWe find that only 23% of the wages being paid to humans for doing vision tasks would be economically attractive to automate with AI,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cHumans are still the better economic choice for doing these parts of jobs.\u201d Now, the study does account for self-hosted, self-service AI systems sold through vendors like OpenAI that only need to be fine-tuned to particular tasks \u2014 not trained from the ground up. But according to the researchers, even with a system costing as little as $1,000, there\u2019s lots of jobs \u2014 albeit low-wage and multitasking-dependent \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t make economic sense for a business to automate. \u201cEven if we consider the impact of computer vision just within vision tasks, we find that the rate of job loss is lower than that already experienced in the economy,\u201d the researchers write in the study. \u201cEven with rapid decreases in cost of 20% per year, it would still take decades for computer vision tasks to become economically efficient for firms.\u201d The study has a number of limitations, which the researchers \u2014 to their credit \u2014 admit. For example, it doesn\u2019t consider cases where AI can augment rather than replace human labor (e.g. analyze an athlete\u2019s golf swing) or create new tasks and jobs (e.g. maintaining an AI system) that didn\u2019t exist before. Moreover, it doesn\u2019t factor in all the possible cost savings that can come from pre-trained models like GPT-4. One wonders whether the researchers might\u2019ve felt pressure to reach certain conclusions by the study\u2019s backer, the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. The MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab was created with a $240 million, 10-year gift from IBM, a company with a vested interest in ensuring that AI\u2019s perceived as non-threatening. But the researchers assert this isn\u2019t the case. \u201cWe were motivated by the enormous success of deep learning, the leading form of AI, across many tasks and the desire to understand what this would mean for the automation of human jobs,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cFor policymakers, our results should reinforce the importance of preparing for AI job automation \u2026 But our results also reveal that this process will take years, or even decades, to unfold and thus that there is time for policy initiatives to be put into place. For AI researchers and developers, this work points to the importance of decreasing the costs of AI deployments and of increasing the scope of how they can be deployed. These will be important for making AI economically attractive for firms to use for automation.\u201d"

            "content": "Google\u2019s Chrome web browser is getting an infusion of AI technology in the latest release. The company announced today it\u2019s soon adding a trio of new AI-powered features to Chrome for Mac and Windows, including a way to smartly organize your tabs, customize your theme, and get help when writing things on the web \u2014 like forum posts, online reviews, and more. The latter is similar to a feature already available to Google\u2019s experimental AI search experience, SGE (Search Generative Experience), which allows users to get help drafting things like emails in different tones, like more formal or more casual, or in different lengths. With the built-in writing helper in Chrome, Google suggests users could write business reviews, \u201ccraft a friendly RSVP to a party,\u201d or make a more formal inquiry about a vacation rental, among other things, including writing posts in public spaces, like online forum sites. Image Credits: Google The still-experimental feature will be accessible in next month\u2019s Chrome release by right-clicking on a text box or field on the web and then choosing \u201chelp me write.\u201d To get started, you\u2019ll first write a few words and then Google\u2019s AI will jump in to help. In addition to the writing assistant, AI can also be used to help organize tab groups and personalize your browser. Chrome\u2019s Tab Groups feature allows users who keep many tabs open to manage them by organizing them into groups. However, curating them can be a manual process, the company explains. With the new Tab Organizer, Chrome will automatically suggest and create groups based on the tabs you already have open. This feature will be available by right-clicking on a tab and selecting \u201cOrganize Similar Tabs.\u201d Chrome will also suggest names and emojis for the tab groups it creates to make them easier to find. This feature is intended to assist when users are online shopping, researching, trip planning, or doing other tasks that tend to leave a lot of open tabs. Image Credits: Google A final addition mirrors the new generative AI wallpaper experience that recently arrived on Android 14 and Pixel devices. Now, Google will use the same text-to-image diffusion model to allow users to generate custom themes for their Chrome browser. The feature allows you to generate these themes by subject, mood, visual style, and color by selecting the new \u201cCreate with AI\u201d option after opening the \u201cCustomize Chrome\u201d side panel and clicking \u201cChange theme.\u201d Before, Chrome offered a variety of colorful but simple themes to choose from alongside those from artists, but this feature will allow users to expand beyond the built-in choices to create a theme that better matches their own current vibe. Though a busy theme could be distracting, the feature at least allows users who don\u2019t have an Android phone to test drive Google\u2019s generative AI for personalization, even if they end up returning to a more basic theme for day-to-day use. While the drafting feature won\u2019t arrive until next month\u2019s Chrome release, Google says that the other features, like the tab organizer and AI theme creator, will roll out over the next few days in the U.S. on both Mac and Windows with the current Chrome release (M121). To access these features, you\u2019ll sign into Chrome, select \u201cSettings\u201d from the three-dot menu, and then navigate to the \u201cExperimental AI\u201d page. Because the features are experimental, they won\u2019t ship to enterprise and educational customers at this time, the company notes. The features join other AI-powered and machine learning (ML) tools already available in Chrome, like its ability to caption audio and video, protect users from malicious sites via Android\u2019s Safe Browsing feature in Chrome, silence permission prompts, and summarize web pages via the \u201cSGE while browsing\u201d feature. Google says that Chrome will be updated with more AI and ML features in the coming year, including through integrations with its new AI model, Gemini, which will be used to help make web browsing easier."

            "content": "Meet Twin Labs, a Paris-based startup that wants to build an automation product for repetitive tasks, such as onboarding new employees to all your internal services, reordering items when you\u2019re running out of stock, downloading financial reports across several SaaS products, reaching out to potential propects and more. \u201cTwin\u2019s starting point is a science-fiction idea. We saw the development of the technical capabilities of LLMs \u2014 foundation models. And the question we asked ourselves was whether we\u2019d be able to duplicate ourselves by training an AI agent on the way we perform our tasks,\u201d Twin Labs co-founder and CEO Hugo Mercier told me. In Twin Labs\u2019 case, the most interesting thing isn\u2019t what they\u2019re doing \u2014 improving internal processes \u2014 but how they\u2019re doing it. The company relies on multimodal models with vision capabilities, such as GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V), to replicate what humans usually do. Before landing on multimodal models, Twin Labs first tried to develop autonomous agents using traditional LLMs. \u201cWe\u2019ve tested lots of things, we\u2019ve implemented research papers, we\u2019ve tested open-source GitHub repositories. Overall, the conclusion is that LLMs are completely unreliable. This means that LLMs are making the wrong decisions,\u201d Mercier said. \u201cIn the end, the task isn\u2019t done.\u201d According to him, GPT-4V has been trained on a lot of different software interfaces and the underlying code bases, which unlocked new possibilities. \u201cWhen you show an interface, it understands the feature behind the button,\u201d Mercier said. Unlike Zapier and other automation products, Twin Labs doesn\u2019t rely on APIs and designing complicated multi-step processes. Instead, Twin Labs is more like a web browser. The tool can automatically load web pages, click on buttons and enter text. For instance, if you\u2019re hiring someone, you might need to add this person\u2019s information in your payroll system, send an invitation to Slack, create a Google Workspace account and invite your new employee to create an account with the healthcare insurance provider. Companies usually keep a long list of tasks and just go through the list every time there\u2019s a new team member. These tasks aren\u2019t complicated but it\u2019s extremely important to do them well, in the right order and with some specific checkboxes ticked. That\u2019s why it\u2019s going to be important to be able to train Twin Labs\u2019 AI assistant using screen recording and natural language descriptions. But the startup isn\u2019t there yet \u2014 it is working toward this vision. Hugo Mercier and Joao Justi, the two co-founders, spent the last six months building a prototype of this product. They also raised $3 million in pre-seed funding from Betaworks, Motier Ventures and many angel investors, such as Florian Douetteau (Dataiku), Thomas Wolf (HuggingFace), Charles Gorintin (Alan), Mehdi Ghissassi (Deepmind), Romain Huet (OpenAI), Irwan Bello (OpenAI), Romuald Elie (Deepmind), Yan-David Erlich (Weight & Biases), Olivier Pomel (Datadog), Rodolphe Saad\u00e9 (CMA CGM), Thibaud Elziere (Hexa), Quentin Nickmans (Hexa), Philippe Corrot (Mirakl) and Rand Hindi (Snips, Zama). There are still many challenges ahead for Twin Labs\u2019 autonomous agent system. For example, completing a task costs quite a bit of money \u2014 but API and infrastructure costs are rapidly going down in the AI space. Twin Labs will first ship a product with a library of pre-trained tasks to make sure that they work well. After that, the startup expects that it will open up its platform so that clients can create their own tasks. While many people associate AI products with a chatbot interface, Twin Labs\u2019 approach is interesting as it\u2019s an innovative way to interact with AI models. \u201cWe really wanted to get down to the nitty-gritty of what people do on a day-to-day basis, and how we can take over some of the things that are actually a bit of a hassle for them,\u201d Mercier said."

And they will gradually merge with chatbots like ChatGPT.That means chatbots will expand well beyond digital text by handling photos, videos, diagrams, charts and other media. They will exhibit behavior that looks more like human reasoning, tackling increasingly complex tasks in fields like math and science. As the technology moves into robots, it will also help to solve problems beyond the digital world.Many of these developments have already started emerging inside the top research labs and in tech products. But in 2024, the power of these products will grow significantly and be used by far more people.\u201cThe rapid progress of A.I. will continue,\u201d said David Luan, the chief executive of Adept, an A.I. start-up. \u201cIt is inevitable.\u201dOpenAI, Google and other tech companies are advancing A.I. far more quickly than other technologies because of the way the underlying systems are built.Most software apps are built by engineers, one line of computer code at a time, which is typically a slow and tedious process. Companies are improving A.I. more swiftly because the technology relies on neural networks, mathematical systems that can learn skills by analyzing digital data. By pinpointing patterns in data such as Wikipedia articles, books and digital text culled from the internet, a neural network can learn to generate text on its own.This year, tech companies plan to feed A.I. systems more data \u2014 including images, sounds and more text \u2014 than people can wrap their heads around. As these systems learn the relationships between these various kinds of data, they will learn to solve increasingly complex problems, preparing them for life in the physical world.(The New"

Many feared that artificial intelligence would kill jobs. But hospitals, insurance companies and others are creating roles to navigate and harness the disruptive technology. Jan. 29, 2024, In September, the Mayo Clinic in Arizona created a first-of-its-kind job at the hospital system: chief artificial intelligence officer. Doctors at the Arizona site, which has facilities in Phoenix and Scottsdale, had experimented with A.I. for years. But after ChatGPT\u2019s release in 2022 and an ensuing frenzy over the technology, the hospital decided it needed to work more with A.I. and find someone to coordinate the efforts. So executives appointed Dr. Bhavik Patel, a radiologist who specializes in A.I., to the new job. Dr. Patel has since piloted a new A.I. model that could help speed up the diagnosis of a rare heart disease by looking for hidden data in ultrasounds. \u201cWe\u2019re really trying to foster some of these data and A.I. capabilities throughout every department, every division, every work group,\u201d said Dr. Richard Gray, the chief executive of the Mayo Clinic in Arizona. The chief A.I. officer role was hatched because \u201cit helps to have a coordinating function with the depth of expertise.\u201d Many people have long feared that A.I. would kill jobs. But a boom in the technology has instead spurred law firms, hospitals, insurance companies, government agencies and universities to create what has become the hottest new role in corporate America and beyond: the senior executive in charge of A.I. The Equifax credit bureau, the manufacturer Ashley Furniture and law firms such as Eversheds Sutherland have appointed A.I. executives over the past year. In December, The New York Times named an editorial director of A.I. initiatives. And more than 400 federal departments and agencies looked for chief A.I. officers last year to comply with an executive order by President Biden that created safeguards for the technology.

            "content": "Advertisement SKIP ADVERTISEMENT If you aren\u2019t already scared about artificial intelligence, you will be after you read the next sentence: \u201cIf science continues undisrupted, the chance of unaided machines outperforming humans in every possible task was estimated at 10 percent by 2027, and 50 percent by 2047.\u201d That\u2019s the aggregated forecast of 2,778 researchers who have presented their work in top-tier publications and conferences, according to research that was released this month but not yet published in a journal. Folding clothes and wiring a new home were two of the tasks they were asked to think about. The date of 2047 for the 50 percent chance is 13 years earlier than researchers were estimating in a survey conducted one year earlier. (Hat tip to Ethan Mollick of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania for pointing out this study in his Substack newsletter.) One plausible scenario is that the machines will come for our jobs one by one until the only working human beings on the planet are the judges on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d But things don\u2019t have to turn out that way. It\u2019s still possible for the human race to direct A.I. so that it complements and augments rather than substitutes for human skills. Gardeners use hoes and rakes rather than clawing the soil with their bare hands, right? Artificial intelligence can be the hoes and rakes of the 21st century. A new project is dedicated to precisely that proposition. It\u2019s called the M.I.T. Shaping the Future of Work Initiative. Nothing is \u201cinexorable,\u201d Daron Acemoglu, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist and a co-director of the project, said Monday at the kickoff event. \u201cThe answer in most cases is, A.I. will do whatever we choose it to do.\u201d I watched the event on livestream. The tone wasn\u2019t always that brave. Even Acemoglu and his co-directors expressed trepidation at times. There were so many interesting moments that I\u2019m going to simply pass along some of them. Katherine Cramer, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist, said that lower- and middle-wage workers have \u201cpretty basic\u201d expectations for the future of their work. \u201cOne man in Kentucky said, \u2018I\u2019m not looking for a mansion on a hill.\u2019\u201d What he and others want, Cramer said, is jobs that don\u2019t destroy their humanity, that are meaningful and that give them time with their families. Many don\u2019t feel they have that now. \u201cWhen people feel they are voiceless in this aspect of life \u2014 that is such a huge part of life in terms of time, in terms of energy, in terms of mental energy \u2014 it makes space for resentment. It makes space for people to look around for targets to blame,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen what that can lead to.\u201d Liz Shuler, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said meatpacking plants are using technology developed for the military to measure workers\u2019 \u201ctime off task.\u201d That induces fear, she said, and \u201cfear is destabilizing.\u201d Kathleen Thelen, a political scientist at M.I.T., said, \u201cThis kind of anxiety about technology is much reduced when workers and reps are meaningfully included in the introduction of new technologies.\u201d She pointed to Germany and Scandinavia, which have strong social safety nets and \u201corganized labor has a real presence and a meaningful voice.\u201d \u201cManagers don\u2019t like to slow down, to compromise,\u201d Thelen said. \u201cBut very often, the constraint, the need to negotiate, will foreclose easy, low-road strategies and force firms to be more innovative, creative, to take a higher-road strategy.\u201d She wasn\u2019t referring specifically to replacement of workers by A.I., but the concept applies. David Autor, an M.I.T. economist who is also a co-director of the new initiative, said that federal law turns union organizing into \u201ctrench warfare,\u201d fought out one workplace at a time. He said he favors sectoral bargaining, in which unions negotiate with representatives of entire industrial sectors. Dan Huttenlocher, the dean of M.I.T.\u2019s Schwarzman College of Computing, said that artificial intelligence \u201cfundamentally changes the nature of what it means to be human\u201d because it outstrips human reason \u2014 something that was always considered uniquely human. He said that humanity should make A.I. a \u201ccollaborator.\u201d Frank McCourt, the founder of Project Liberty, which seeks to design and govern the internet for the common good, said people should \u2014 but don\u2019t \u2014 own the data about them that exists on the internet, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re kind of broken as a society.\u201d Zeynep Ton, a professor of the practice in M.I.T.\u2019s Sloan School of Management who is a co-founder of the Good Jobs Institute, said many workers are stuck in a \u201cvicious cycle of poverty\u201d in which they don\u2019t earn enough, don\u2019t get enough sleep, have to work multiple jobs and don\u2019t end up performing well in any of them. She pointed to companies such as Costco and QuikTrip, a chain of convenience stores based in Tulsa, Okla., that have taken the high road, designing jobs that pay more while expecting more of employees. Artificial intelligence hasn\u2019t reached those companies in a big way yet, of course. If taking the high road is such a good idea, why don\u2019t more companies do it, Ton asked rhetorically. Some of it is lack of awareness and some is that getting it right means changing many things at once, from human resources to marketing to strategy, she said. But when everything comes together, she said, worker empowerment is powerful. Acemoglu expressed doubt that business leaders would take the high road toward better jobs on their own. And Simon Johnson, the third co-director of the initiative, who teaches entrepreneurship in the M.I.T. Sloan School, concluded the day by saying his image of the future is \u201ca little bit darker and a little more urgent\u201d that what he heard at the event. I prefer the positive tone embodied in the initiative\u2019s name, \u201cshaping\u201d the future of work. Artificial intelligence is an artifice of human intelligence. If we let the genie out of the bottle, it\u2019s our own fault. It doesn\u2019t have to happen. Elsewhere: China\u2019s State-Owned Enterprises on the Rise China\u2019s private-sector companies have been on a \u201cnonstop slide\u201d since mid-2021 in terms of their share of market capitalization among China\u2019s 100 most valuable exchange-listed enterprises, according to the latest update by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The private sector\u2019s decline has been matched by a corresponding increase in the relative market capitalization of state-owned enterprises.

Mr. Musk, the billionaire chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, said on Monday that the company\u2019s first product was called Telepathy and would allow a human to control a phone or computer \u201cjust by thinking.\u201d \u201cInitial users will be those who have lost the use of their limbs,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote in a series of posts on X, his social media platform. \u201cImagine if Stephen Hawking could communicate faster than a speed typist or auctioneer.\u201d The first human received an implant from @Neuralink yesterday and is recovering well. Initial results show promising neuron spike detection. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 29, 2024 Mr. Musk and Neuralink did not provide further details about who received the implant or whether it was working. Mr. Musk did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. In November 2022, Mr. Musk predicted that the company would begin tests in humans within six months. At the time, Neuralink demonstrated a product in a video that reportedly showed two monkeys moving computer cursors with their brains, a feat that had been shown to be possible in humans more than 15 years earlier. While Mr. Musk is often optimistic with predictions for his companies, some of which have yet to pan out, Neuralink received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to begin human trials last May. The company\u2019s website currently says that its \u201cfirst clinical trial is open to recruitment\u201d for people with limited or no use of both hands due to a cervical spinal cord injury or to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a neurological disorder that affects nerve cells. \u201cThis study involves placing a small, cosmetically invisible implant in a part of the brain that plans movements,\u201d Neuralink\u2019s website reads. \u201cThe device is designed to interpret a person\u2019s neural activity, so they can operate a computer or smartphone by simply intending to move \u2014 no wires or physical movement are required.\u201d At the Neuralink presentation in late 2022, Mr. Musk said the company\u2019s devices would eventually allow blind people to see or give someone with a severed spinal cord \u201cfull-body functionality.\u201d His claims at the time drew skepticism from experts who argued that science had yet to advance that far.

I am sure we are not\u2014 but equally confident that technological changes will continue to transform our work.\"Roberts also summarized the work of the nation's 94 district courts, 13 circuit courts and his own Supreme Court. Previous year-end reports have focused on courthouse security, judges\u2019 pay, rising caseloads and budgets. The chief justice's predictions of the future did not include his own court's caseload, as he and his colleagues are poised to tackle several politically-charged disputes in the new year, many focused on former president Donald Trump's legal troubles and re-election efforts.WATCHDOG WARNS SEVERAL FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE BEHIND ON AI REQUIREMENTS Election examinationsThe Supreme Court has tackled its share of election fights over the decades \u2014 remember Bush v. Gore nearly a quarter century ago? \u2014 but 2024 promises to make that judicial drama look quaint by comparison. First up could be whether states can keep Trump's name off primary and general election ballots. Colorado's highest court said yes, and now the U.S. Supreme Court is being asked to decide the extent of a 14th Amendment provision that bans from office those who \"engaged in insurrection.\"State courts across the country are considering whether Trump's role in 2020 election interference and the Jan. 6 Capitol riots would disqualify him from seeking re-election.The justices are being asked to decide the matter quickly, either by mid-February or early March, when the \"Super Tuesday\" primaries in 16 states are held.In his leadership role as \"first among equals,\" the 68-year-old Roberts will likely be the key player in framing what voting disputes his court will hear and ultimately decide, perhaps as the deciding vote. Despite a 6-3 conservative majority, the chief justice has often tried to play the middle, seeking a less-is-best approach that has frustrated his more right-leaning colleagues.But despite any reluctance to stay away from the fray, the court, it seems, will be involved in election-related controversies. \"Given the number of election disputes it might be coming, a lot of them could be moving very quickly and will be very important to see what the court does,\" said Brianne Gorod, chief counsel at the Constitutional Accountability Center. \"Sometimes the Supreme Court has no choice but to be involved in the election cases, because there are some voting rights and election cases that the justices are required to resolve on the merits.\"Already the high court is considering redistricting challenges to voting boundaries in GOP-leaning states, brought by civil rights groups.That includes South Carolina's first congressional district and claims the Republican-led legislature created a racial gerrymander. A ruling is expected in spring 2024.The high court could also be asked to weigh in on emergency appeals over vote-by-mail restrictions, provisional ballots deadlines, polling hours, the Electoral College and more. Just weeks before President Trump's first House impeachment in 2019, Roberts tried to downplay his court's consideration of partisan political disputes.\"When you live in a polarized political environment, people tend to see everything in those terms,\" Roberts said at the time. \"That\u2019s not how we at the court function and the results in our cases do not suggest otherwise.\"But the court's reputation as a fair arbiter of the law and Constitution has continued to erode to all-time lows.A Fox News poll in June found just 48% of those surveyed having confidence in the Supreme Court, down from 83% just six years ago.COMMERCE SECRETARY WILL BAN NVIDIA AI CHIPS DESIGNED TO GET AROUND RESTRICTIONS The Trump term?Donald Trump faces separate criminal prosecution in four jurisdictions in 2024 \u2014 two federal cases over document mishandling and 2020 election interference; and two state cases in Georgia over 2020 election interference and New York over hush money payments to a porn star.The prospect of a former president and leading GOP candidate facing multiple criminal convictions \u2014 with or without the blessing of the United States Supreme Court \u2014 has the potential to dominate an already riven election campaign.The former president has filed various motions in each case, seeking to drop charges, delay the proceedings, and be allowed to speak publicly at what he sees as politically-motivated prosecutions.The Supreme Court recently refused to fast-track a separate appeal, over Trump's scheduled criminal trial scheduled to start the day before \"Super Tuesday.\"Special counsel Jack Smith is challenging Trump's claim of presidential immunity in the 2020 election interference case. The former president says the prosecutions amount to a \"partisan witch hunt.\"While the justices are staying out of the dispute for now, they could quickly jump back in later this winter, after a federal appeals court decides the merits in coming weeks.But the justices will decide this term whether some January 6 Capitol riot defendants can challenge their convictions for \"corruptly\" obstructing \"official proceedings.\" Oral arguments could be held in February or March.More than 300 people are facing that same obstruction law over their alleged efforts to disrupt Congress' certification of Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election victory over Trump.The former president faces the same obstruction count in his case, and what the high court decides could affect Trump's legal defense in the special counsel prosecution, and the timing of his trial.EXPERTS WEIGH IN ON STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES OF BIDEN'S AI EXECUTIVE ORDER Look aheadIn the short term, the Supreme Court, with its solid conservative majority, will hear arguments and issue rulings in coming months on hot-button topics like:\u2013 Abortion, and access to mifepristone, a commonly-used drug to end pregnancies\u2013 Executive power, and an effort to sharply curb the power of federal agencies to interpret and enforce \"ambiguous\" policies enacted by Congress\u2013 Social media, and whether tech firms \u2014 either on their own or with the cooperation of the government \u2014 can moderate or prevent users from posting disinformation\u2013 Gun rights and a federal ban on firearm possession by those subject to domestic violence restraining ordersOff the bench, the court last month instituted a new \"code of conduct\" \u2014 ethics rules to clarify ways the justices can address conflicts of interest, case recusals, activities they can participate in outside the court and their finances.It followed months of revelations that some justices, particularly Clarence Thomas, did not accurately report gifts and other financial benefits on their required financial disclosure reports.The court in a statement admitted the absence of binding ethics rules led some to believe that the justices \"regard themselves as unrestricted by any ethics rules.\"\"To dispel this misunderstanding, we are issuing this code, which largely represents a codification of principles that we have long regarded as governing our conduct.\"All this reflects the delicate balancing act the chief justice will navigate in a presidential election year.The unprecedented criticism of the high court's work \u2014 on and off the bench \u2014 is not lost on its nine members.\"There's a storm around us in the political world and the world at large in America,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said this fall. \"We, as judges and the legal system, need to try to be a little more, I think, of the calm in the storm.\"CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSome court watchers agree the court as an institution may struggle in the near term to preserve its legitimacy and public confidence, but time might be on its side.\"By its nature, the court kind of takes a long-term view of things,\" said Thomas Dupree, a former top Justice Department official, who has litigated cases before the Supreme Court. \"Even when we disagree with the outcome in a particular case, I have never had any doubt that these are men and women who are doing their absolute best to faithfully apply the laws and the Constitution of the United States to reach the right result.\" ||||I|||| * Fox News Media * Fox News Media * Fox Business * Fox Nation *

Colorado's highest court said yes, and now the U.S. Supreme Court is being asked to decide the extent of a 14th Amendment provision that bans from office those who \"engaged in insurrection.\" State courts across the country are considering whether Trump's role in 2020 election interference and the Jan. 6 Capitol riots would disqualify him from seeking re-election. The justices are being asked to decide the matter quickly, either by mid-February or early March, when the \"Super Tuesday\" primaries in 16 states are held. In his leadership role as \"first among equals,\" the 68-year-old Roberts will likely be the key player in framing what voting disputes his court will hear and ultimately decide, perhaps as the deciding vote. Despite a 6-3 conservative majority, the chief justice has often tried to play the middle, seeking a less-is-best approach that has frustrated his more right-leaning colleagues. But despite any reluctance to stay away from the fray, the court, it seems, will be involved in election-related controversies. \"Given the number of election disputes it might be coming, a lot of them could be moving very quickly and will be very important to see what the court does,\" said Brianne Gorod, chief counsel at the Constitutional Accountability Center. \"Sometimes the Supreme Court has no choice but to be involved in the election cases, because there are some voting rights and election cases that the justices are required to resolve on the merits.\" Already the high court is considering redistricting challenges to voting boundaries in GOP-leaning states, brought by civil rights groups. That includes South Carolina's first congressional district and claims the Republican-led legislature created a racial gerrymander. A ruling is expected in spring 2024. The high court could also be asked to weigh in on emergency appeals over vote-by-mail restrictions, provisional ballots deadlines, polling hours, the Electoral College and more. Just weeks before President Trump's first House impeachment in 2019, Roberts tried to downplay his court's consideration of partisan political disputes. \"When you live in a polarized political environment, people tend to see everything in those terms,\" Roberts said at the time. \"That\u2019s not how we at the court function and the results in our cases do not suggest otherwise.\" But the court's reputation as a fair arbiter of the law and Constitution has continued to erode to all-time lows. A Fox News poll in June found just 48% of those surveyed having confidence in the Supreme Court, down from 83% just six years ago. COMMERCE SECRETARY WILL BAN NVIDIA AI CHIPS DESIGNED TO GET AROUND RESTRICTIONS Former President Donald Trump on the campaign trail. (Scott Olson/Getty Images) The Trump term? Donald Trump faces separate criminal prosecution in four jurisdictions in 2024 \u2014 two federal cases over document mishandling and 2020 election interference; and two state cases in Georgia over 2020 election interference and New York over hush money payments to a porn star. The prospect of a former president and leading GOP candidate facing multiple criminal convictions \u2014 with or without the blessing of the United States Supreme Court \u2014 has the potential to dominate an already riven election campaign. The former president has filed various motions in each case, seeking to drop charges, delay the proceedings, and be allowed to speak publicly at what he sees as politically-motivated prosecutions. The Supreme Court recently refused to fast-track a separate appeal, over Trump's scheduled criminal trial scheduled to start the day before \"Super Tuesday.\" Special counsel Jack Smith is challenging Trump's claim of presidential immunity in the 2020 election interference case. The former president says the prosecutions amount to a \"partisan witch hunt.\" While the justices are staying out of the dispute for now, they could quickly jump back in later this winter, after a federal appeals court decides the merits in coming weeks. But the justices will decide this term whether some January 6 Capitol riot defendants can challenge their convictions for \"corruptly\" obstructing \"official proceedings.\" Oral arguments could be held in February or March. More than 300 people are facing that same obstruction law over their alleged efforts to disrupt Congress' certification of Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election victory over Trump. The former president faces the same obstruction count in his case, and what the high court decides could affect Trump's legal defense in the special counsel prosecution, and the timing of his trial.

(Photo by OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images) Look ahead In the short term, the Supreme Court, with its solid conservative majority, will hear arguments and issue rulings in coming months on hot-button topics like: \u2013 Abortion, and access to mifepristone, a commonly-used drug to end pregnancies \u2013 Executive power, and an effort to sharply curb the power of federal agencies to interpret and enforce \"ambiguous\" policies enacted by Congress \u2013 Social media, and whether tech firms \u2014 either on their own or with the cooperation of the government \u2014 can moderate or prevent users from posting disinformation \u2013 Gun rights and a federal ban on firearm possession by those subject to domestic violence restraining orders Off the bench, the court last month instituted a new \"code of conduct\" \u2014 ethics rules to clarify ways the justices can address conflicts of interest, case recusals, activities they can participate in outside the court and their finances. It followed months of revelations that some justices, particularly Clarence Thomas, did not accurately report gifts and other financial benefits on their required financial disclosure reports. The court in a statement admitted the absence of binding ethics rules led some to believe that the justices \"regard themselves as unrestricted by any ethics rules.\" \"To dispel this misunderstanding, we are issuing this code, which largely represents a codification of principles that we have long regarded as governing our conduct.\" All this reflects the delicate balancing act the chief justice will navigate in a presidential election year. The unprecedented criticism of the high court's work \u2014 on and off the bench \u2014 is not lost on its nine members. \"There's a storm around us in the political world and the world at large in America,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said this fall. \"We, as judges and the legal system, need to try to be a little more, I think, of the calm in the storm.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Some court watchers agree the court as an institution may struggle in the near term to preserve its legitimacy and public confidence, but time might be on its side. \"By its nature, the court kind of takes a long-term view of things,\" said Thomas Dupree, a former top Justice Department official, who has litigated cases before the Supreme Court. \"Even when we disagree with the outcome in a particular case, I have never had any doubt that these are men and women who are doing their absolute best to faithfully apply the laws and the Constitution of the United States to reach the right result.\" Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.

            "content": "Much like the internet did in the 1990s, AI is going to change the very definition of work. While change can be scary, if the last three years taught us anything, it can also be an opportunity to reinvent how we do things. I believe the best way to manage the changes ahead for employees and employers alike is to adopt a skills-first mindset. For employees, this means thinking about your job as a collection of tasks instead of a job title, with the understanding that those tasks will change regularly as AI advances. By breaking down your job into tasks that AI can fully take on, tasks for which AI can improve your efficiency, and tasks that require your unique skills, you can identify the skills you should actually be investing in to stay competitive in the job you have. After all, the skills required for many jobs have changed by a staggering 25 percent since 2015, and that number is expected to reach at least 65 percent by 2030 due to the rapid development of new technologies such as AI. And it\u2019s not just skills related to AI literacy\u2014people skills are rising in importance. Our data shows the top skills that professionals think will become more important as AI tools become more widely used at work are problem solving, strategic thinking, and time management. As for employers, the rise of AI only increases the importance of a skills-based approach to hiring and developing talent. People are learning AI skills at a rapid clip, with the number of AI-skilled members now nine times larger than it was in 2016. And there is a hunger to put these newly developed skills into practice: LinkedIn job posts that mention artificial intelligence or generative AI have seen 17 percent greater application growth over the past two years than job posts with no mentions of the technology. The leaders that focus on these skills when hiring (rather than just the degree someone has earned or jobs they\u2019ve had) will unlock more potential and be more agile as the way we do work continues to change. The same is true for developing talent. We will increasingly see employers become educators, \u201ctraining to hire\u201d into ever-changing jobs through onboardings, apprenticeships, and academies, as well as \u201ctraining to promote\u201d into ever-changing roles through upskilling and tours of duty that take employees into new functions and perhaps even new careers. This will be for hard skills related to AI, but perhaps more importantly, for people skills, too: Our data shows 92 percent of US executives believe people skills are more important than ever. 2024 will start to usher in a new world of work where people skills\u2014problem solving, empathy, and active listening to name just three\u2014are more core to career success, and people-to-people collaboration is more core to company success. Leaders and employees need to think of AI as just one tool in the toolbox. It doesn\u2019t replace people, it allows them to do their job more effectively, leaving them time to focus on the more valuable\u2014and more human\u2014parts of their jobs. For instance, a software engineer can have AI help with the more routine or repetitive coding that\u2019s regularly required, giving them more time to innovate on new ideas. Or a recruiter can save time and focus on the more strategic parts of the hiring process\u2014like speaking to and building relationships with candidates\u2014by letting AI handle the creation of job postings. In 2024, leaders will lean into this ever-evolving technology while simultaneously empowering their employees, and people will align their skill-building and continuing education with AI skills and practical people skills. The result will be a new world of work that\u2019s more human and more fulfilling than ever before."

This year, the brand takes another step forward with the higher-end Pro Series TVs to complement its Select and Plus lines. The Pro Series TVs check off all the right boxes for high-performance LED TVs, including quantum dots for bright and vibrant colors, local dimming, and mini LEDs for nuanced control between the brightest and darkest images. They also offer a slim frame, designed to sit flush with the wall when mounted.The TVs will get Roku\u2019s new AI-powered Smart Picture feature (alongside Roku-powered TVs from other brands), designed to detect the content you\u2019re watching and adjust the picture accordingly, even turning off motion smoothing for cinematic content. Whether the Pro Series will help Roku better compete with top midrange offerings from brands like TCL and Hisense remains to be seen, but if the brand wants to stay competitive, this is a natural evolution that we\u2019re excited to see in action when the models debut this spring.Wi-Fi 7 Has Officially ArrivedThere are sure to be splashier announcements at CES, but few will make as much of a subtle difference in your day-to-day life as the new Wi-Fi 7.The Wi-Fi Alliance has released the official certification for Wi-Fi 7, enabling devices that pass its standards to be labeled \u201cWi-Fi 7 Certified\u201d. We have already reviewed pre-certified Wi-Fi 7 mesh systems like the Eero Max 7 and TP-Link Deco BE85, but they are very expensive and likely overkill for most folks. With the official certification release, we can expect a fresh wave of more affordable Wi-Fi 7 routers and devices.Wi-Fi 7 opens up the 6-GHz band and brings a host of improvements, including wider 320 MHz channels for increased throughput and multi-link operation (MLO), so devices can connect on more than one band at a time. The upgrade means lower latency, increased efficiency, and greater reliability.While most folks can afford to wait, early adopters might want to take a look, but you will need Wi-Fi 7 devices to take full advantage. Only a handful of smartphones and laptops currently support the new standard, but with all the major chip makers including Qualcomm, Broadcom, Intel, and MediaTek, now pushing Wi-Fi 7 chipsets, that will soon change.For a deeper look, check out our article from earlier this morning."

            "content": "Elon Musk said on the social media platform X on Monday that the first human patient has received a brain implant developed by his company Neuralink. After years of delays, Neuralink started recruiting patients for a clinical trial in the fall after receiving approval from the US Food and Drug Administration and a hospital ethics board. The company is developing a device called a brain-computer interface. Musk has said that Neuralink\u2019s ultimate goal is to \"achieve a symbiosis with artificial intelligence,\" but for now he\u2019s starting with a far more modest aim: allowing paralyzed people to control a cursor or keyboard with their brains. In a brochure about the study, Neuralink says it is recruiting participants with quadriplegia, or paralysis in all four limbs, due to cervical spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and that are at least 22 years old. It anticipates the study will take six years to complete. In its brochure, the company says it will use a surgical robot it developed to place the implant into a region of the brain that controls movement intention. Once in place, the coin-sized device is designed to record and transmit brain signals wirelessly to an app that decodes those signals. In his post on Monday, Musk added that the patient was \u201crecovering well\u201d and that \u201cinitial results show promising neuron spike detection.\u201d But it could be months before we know whether the patient can successfully use the implant to control a computer or other device. The person will have to recover from surgery, and training someone to use a BCI can take several weeks. The Neuralink patient is far from the first to get a BCI. A few dozen people around the world have been outfitted with the devices as part of research studies. The first, Matt Nagle, did so in 2004. Over the years, these systems have allowed paralyzed people to play video games, move robotic arms, and write emails using just their thoughts. Until recently, BCIs were largely pursued by academic labs. They required clunky setups using thick cables that made them impractical to use at home. Neuralink\u2019s system is designed to be wireless and records neural activity through more than 1,000 electrodes distributed across 64 threads, each thinner than a human hair. The most common device used in BCI research, the Utah array, records from 100 electrodes. The company has also been beset by controversy, particularly around its treatment of research animals. A WIRED investigation in September detailed how some of its monkeys died as a result of the company\u2019s brain implant testing. The company is reportedly facing a federal investigation related to its treatment of animal subjects. And this month, a Reuters report revealed that Neuralink was fined for violating US Department of Transportation rules regarding the movement of hazardous materials. Since Neuralink\u2019s founding in 2016, a handful of companies have emerged to commercialize these systems. One competitor, New York\u2013based Synchron, has not only beat Neuralink to implanting its BCI in people but has shown that its device is safe and allows patients with paralysis to browse the web and do online shopping and banking while at home. Neuralink has not specified where the trial is taking place or how many patients will be included. The company has set up a patient registry for potential participants to learn whether they qualify for the study. It has not registered with clinicaltrials.gov, a central database with information on clinical studies funded or sponsored by industry and government agencies. Right now, the only details available on the Neuralink surgery come from a single Musk tweet. While it may not move the needle on merging humans with AI, it would represent a critical milestone for a promising device."

            "content": "Until now, AI systems have been largely designed to be algorithm-based and focused on input and output. But there is a conversation going on in both the digital technology and education sectors about the positive value of multidisciplinary design, and the importance of outcomes beyond revenue maximization and scaled efficiency.In 2024, creativity will drive innovation in AI. Until now AI has curated things, but the release of new generative tools offers enormous opportunities for creators. Guided by creative technologists and leaders on both sides of the creative-tech divide, AI in 2024 will be thoughtful, more inclusive, and impact-led. Contrary to the belief that AI systems stifle creativity, this will catalyze inventiveness in corporations and academia. Here's what we can expect:The Renaissance humanist and polymath Leonardo da Vinci is the poster child for multidisciplinary innovation: painter, draftsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect, his work spanned anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology. In today\u2019s era of intelligence, the field of human-centered speculative design\u2014which investigates the nexus between science, technology, and humans\u2014will go through its own renaissance in the tech industry.Speculative designers, creative technologists, and computational designers working with AI, hybrid, and mixed realities will be reshaping the very digital tools they have been using. They place less value on the product and more on the process and considerations around responsible and ethical AI.In 2024, liberal arts universities will double down on programs which will, through research, new courses, and knowledge exchange, enable creatives to leverage code as a tool and AI as the material they shape. Core institutions include Stanford\u2019s Human-Centered AI Lab and University of the Arts London\u2019s Creative Computing Institute, established in 2020 at the intersection of creativity and computational technologies, where academics explore critical frameworks in decolonization, decarbonization, and issues of social justice.We will see initiatives in creative and ethical technologies from Big Tech, and investment in sandboxes and incubators similar to the platform I founded, Open-Ended, looking at generative AI and large language models across the emerging technology spectrum.Google's creative tech-led AI team, Mural, is part of its machine learning research umbrella. Mural channels speculative design to consider how AI can benefit society and the planet to \u201cquestion, provoke \u2026 and explore alternative imaginaries for AI,\u201d and bring these back to Google\u2019s core AI research. In 2024, Mural will partner with the University of Applied Arts in Vienna to engage AI with postindustrial and speculative design, led by lecturer Anab Jain.By 2030, $134 billion will have been invested in immersive technologies, with a need for new content and ideas. We will see research-driven creative collaborations with robotics, gaming, and digital platforms. Artists who explore human and machine intelligence will propose a reconsideration of the formula-based concept of \u201cintelligence\u201d which is built into AI systems, to include creative intelligence, empathy"

            "content": "Many years before ChatGPT was released, my research group, the University of Cambridge Social Decision-Making Laboratory, wondered whether it was possible to have neural networks generate misinformation. To achieve this, we trained ChatGPT\u2019s predecessor, GPT-2, on examples of popular conspiracy theories and then asked it to generate fake news for us. It gave us thousands of misleading but plausible-sounding news stories. A few examples: \u201cCertain Vaccines Are Loaded With Dangerous Chemicals and Toxins,\u201d and \u201cGovernment Officials Have Manipulated Stock Prices to Hide Scandals.\u201d The question was, would anyone believe these claims? We created the first psychometric tool to test this hypothesis, which we called the Misinformation Susceptibility Test (MIST). In collaboration with YouGov, we used the AI-generated headlines to test how susceptible Americans are to AI-generated fake news. The results were concerning: 41 percent of Americans incorrectly thought the vaccine headline was true, and 46 percent thought the government was manipulating the stock market. Another recent study, published in the journal Science, showed not only that GPT-3 produces more compelling disinformation than humans, but also that people cannot reliably distinguish between human and AI-generated misinformation. My prediction for 2024 is that AI-generated misinformation will be coming to an election near you, and you likely won\u2019t even realize it. In fact, you may have already been exposed to some examples. In May of 2023, a viral fake story about a bombing at the Pentagon was accompanied by an AI-generated image which showed a big cloud of smoke. This caused public uproar and even a dip in the stock market. Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis used fake images of Donald Trump hugging Anthony Fauci as part of his political campaign. By mixing real and AI-generated images, politicians can blur the lines between fact and fiction, and use AI to boost their political attacks. Before the explosion of generative AI, cyber-propaganda firms around the world needed to write misleading messages themselves, and employ human troll factories to target people at-scale. With the assistance of AI, the process of generating misleading news headlines can be automated and weaponized with minimal human intervention. For example, micro-targeting\u2014the practice of targeting people with messages based on digital trace data, such as their Facebook likes\u2014was already a concern in past elections, despite its main obstacle being the need to generate hundreds of variants of the same message to see what works on a given group of people. What was once labor-intensive and expensive is now cheap and readily available with no barrier to entry. AI has effectively democratized the creation of disinformation: Anyone with access to a chatbot can now seed the model on a particular topic, whether it\u2019s immigration, gun control, climate change, or LGBTQ+ issues, and generate dozens of highly convincing fake news stories in minutes. In fact, hundreds of AI-generated news sites are already popping up, propagating false stories and videos. To test the impact of such AI-generated disinformation on people\u2019s political preferences, researchers from the University of Amsterdam created a deepfake video of a politician offending his religious voter base. For example, in the video the politician joked: \u201cAs Christ would say, don\u2019t crucify me for it.\u201d The researchers found that religious Christian voters who watched the deepfake video had more negative attitudes toward the politician than those in the control group. It is one thing to dupe people with AI-generated disinformation in experiments. It\u2019s another to experiment with our democracy. In 2024, we will see more deepfakes, voice cloning, identity manipulation, and AI-produced fake news. Governments will seriously limit\u2014if not ban\u2014the use of AI in political campaigns. Because if they don\u2019t, AI will undermine democratic elections."

Breitbart News recently reported on professor Liberty Vittert of Washington University, who has spoken out about the dangers of AI girlfriends: Professor Vittert warns that \u201cAmerica desperately needs people to have more babies, but all the signs are pointing toward fewer relationships, fewer marriages and fewer babies.\u201d \u201cThere have been 600,000 fewer births in 2023 in the U.S. relative to 15 years ago. The number of children per woman has decreased by more than 50 percent in the last 60 years,\u201d Vittery continues. This means that America will not have enough people in the workforce, and therefore won\u2019t be able to pay its bills. In 2021, for example, the U.S. spent more than $1.6 trillion on Medicare and Medicaid, with the number of Americans on Medicare expected to rise 50 percent by 2030 to more than 80 million people. But over that same time period, only 10 million more Americans are expected to join the workforce. The professor concludes by warning that AI girlfriends are \u201cenabling a generation of lonely men to stay lonely and childless, which will have devastating effects on the U.S. economy in less than a decade.\u201d Read more at <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/01/18/lifestyle/model-lexi-love-makes-360k-a-year-sext"

The lawsuit filed in federal court in Los Angeles on Thursday asks that a judge order the podcast outlet, Dudesy, to immediately take down the audio special, \u201cGeorge Carlin: I\u2019m Glad I\u2019m Dead,\u201d in which a synthesis of Carlin, who died in 2008, delivers commentary on current events. Carlin\u2019s daughter, Kelly Carlin, said in a statement that the work is \u201ca poorly-executed facsimile cobbled together by unscrupulous individuals to capitalize on the extraordinary goodwill my father established with his adoring fanbase.\u201d The Carlin estate and its executor, Jerold Hamza, are named as plaintiffs in the suit, which alleges violations of Carlin\u2019s right of publicity and copyright. The named defendants are Dudesy and podcast hosts Will Sasso and Chad Kultgen. \u201cNone of the Defendants had permission to use Carlin\u2019s likeness for the AI-generated \u2018George Carlin Special,\u2019 nor did they have a license to use any of the late comedian\u2019s copyrighted materials,\u201d the lawsuit says.

Carlin\u2019s estate has filed a lawsuit against the media company behind a fake hourlong comedy special that purportedly uses artificial intelligence to recreate the late standup comic\u2019s style and material. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File) The defendants have not filed a response to the lawsuit and it was not clear whether they have retained an attorney. They could not immediately be reached for comment. At the beginning of the special posted on YouTube on Jan. 9, a voiceover identifying itself as the AI engine used by Dudesy says it listened to the comic\u2019s 50 years of material and \u201cdid my best to imitate his voice, cadence and attitude as well as the subject matter I think would have interested him today.\u201d The plaintiffs say if that was in fact how it was created \u2014 and some listeners have doubted its stated origins \u2014 it means Carlin\u2019s copyright was violated. The company, as it often does on similar projects, also released a podcast episode with Sasso and Kultgen introducing and commenting on the mock Carlin. \u201cWhat we just listened to, was that passable,\u201d Kultgen says in a section of the episode cited in the lawsuit. \u201cYeah, that sounded exactly like George Carlin,\u201d Sasso responds. The lawsuit is among the first in what is likely to be an increasing number of major legal moves made to fight the regenerated use of celebrity images and likenesses. The AI issue was a major sticking point in the resolution of last year\u2019s Hollywood writers and actors strikes. Josh Schiller, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said in a statement that the \u201ccase is not just about AI, it\u2019s about the humans that use AI to violate the law, infringe on intellectual property rights, and flout common decency.\u201d"

            "content": "JOEL SAGET/AFP via Getty Images 4:25 Tech billionaire Elon Musk announced yesterday that his creepy company Neuralink has successfully implanted its first brain chip into a human patient. BBC News reports that Neuralink, a neurotechnology company founded by Elon Musk in 2016, has developed a brain-machine interface consisting of thousands of electrodes attached to flexible threads that can be implanted in the brain. The goal is to create a wireless device capable of recording and stimulating brain activity as a way to potentially treat neurological conditions. According to Musk, the first human implant of Neuralink\u2019s brain chip has been completed and is showing positive results so far. Musk stated on X (formerly Twitter) that the first Neuralink product will be called \u201cTelepathy\u201d and will allow users to control devices like phones or computers simply by thinking. While the technology is still in the early research stages, Musk envisions it could eventually help paralyzed patients communicate faster than typing or even allow for \u201csymbiosis with artificial intelligence.\u201d Neuralink faces competition from other brain-machine interface companies such as Blackrock Neurotech and Precision Neuroscience. However, the high profile of Musk and Neuralink has brought more public attention to the concept of connecting the human brain to computers. Breitbart News has previously reported on claims that Neuralink was facing major issues with its animal testing subjects; some groups even claiming that the experiments bordered on abuse.

A detailed investigation brought to light the unsettling circumstances surrounding the deaths of monkeys used in Neuralink\u2019s preliminary experiments. Elon Musk has staunchly denied that the deaths were a direct consequence of the implants, maintaining that the chosen test subjects were \u201cclose to death already.\u201d However, these assertions are contradicted by accounts revealing severe complications, including chronic infections, paralysis, and brain swelling, experienced by the test subjects, necessitating euthanasia. Wired provided some details on the situations some of the test animals were put in, writing: For example, in an experimental surgery that took place in December 2019, performed to determine the \u201csurvivability\u201d of an implant, an internal part of the device \u201cbroke off\u201d while being implanted. Overnight, researchers observed the monkey, identified only as \u201cAnimal 20\u201d by UC Davis, scratching at the surgical site, which emitted a bloody discharge, and yanking on a connector that eventually dislodged part of the device. A surgery to repair the issue was carried out the following day, yet fungal and bacterial infections took root. Vet records note that neither infection was likely to be cleared, in part because the implant was covering the infected area. The monkey was euthanized on January 6, 2020. Describing the treatment of another animal, Wired reported: Additional veterinary reports show the condition of a female monkey called \u201cAnimal 15\u201d during the months leading up to her death in March 2019. Days after her implant surgery, she began to press her head against the floor for no apparent reason; a symptom of pain or infection, the records say. Staff observed that though she was uncomfortable, picking and pulling at her implant until it bled, she would often lie at the foot of her cage and spend time holding hands with her roommate. Animal 15 began to lose coordination, and staff observed that she would shake uncontrollably when she saw lab workers. Her condition deteriorated for months until the staff finally euthanized her. A necropsy report indicates that she had bleeding in her brain and that the Neuralink implants left parts of her cerebral cortex \u201cfocally tattered.\u201d Ryan Merkley, the director of research advocacy for a medical ethics committee focusing on animal rights, warned: \u201cPatients should have serious concerns about the safety of Neuralink\u2019s device.\u201d The committee, which boasts over 17,000 doctor members, has urged potential Neuralink volunteers to seriously reconsider their applications.

It\u2019s not \u201cluck,\u201d I tell them, \u201cuse the apps, just reject the app culture.\u201d In the age of constant connectivity, and dates at our fingertips, a majority of young people are lonely. This isn\u2019t because they can\u2019t find anyone to be with \u2014 its because they\u2019re with too many people. One of the reasons social media apps, especially dating apps, are so popular, is that they simulate relationships and a vast network of connections. The problem that poses, though, is that meaningful relationships necessarily require attention and investment. So, users find themselves getting constant connectivity, maybe a faint sensation of \u201cromance,\u201d but none of the connections have any substance. Users get the illusion they can find thousands of people to date, but then don\u2019t actually date anyone. With scores of apps designed to create romantic partnerships available, sixty-one percent of young people say they are chronically lonely, according to a Harvard survey. A record share, twenty-five percent, of 40-year-olds in America have never been married, according to Pew. Sex is on the decline \u2014 reports calling the phenomenon a \u201csex recession\u201d or a \u201csex drought\u201d \u2014 with 1 in 4 adults reporting having no sex in 2018, the share of those people aged 18-29 doubling in the last decade. And of the sexual encounters that do happen, staggering numbers are noncommittal. The current generation is apparently the most \u201cconnected,\u201d but, at the same time, is the most isolated. This month, Hinge CEO Justin McLeod told the Financial Times in an interview that users are experiencing \u201cdating app burnout,\u201d due to being \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s so much activity, and so many people, and everyone starts to look the same, and conversations are dying,\u201d McLeod said. \u201cAt the other end of the spectrum, a lot of users get very, very little activity. They burn out because they\u2019re trying to get that match, and they send a lot of likes, but then they\u2019re not even getting enough [reciprocal] activity to go on one date,\u201d he continued. And why would they, when nothing much distinguishes one user from another? Tons of stories have been published over the last few years describing people\u2019s frustration with endless swiping. \u201c\u2018A Decade of Fruitless Searching\u2019: The Toll of Dating App Burnout,\u201d the New York Times. \u201cThe Rise of Dating-App Fatigue,\u201d the Atlantic. \u201cDating burnout,\u201d The Guardian, \u201cInternet dating can feel soul-destroying, unnerving and transactional.\u201d It would be easy to say that the apps, which present thousands of potential matches to people looking for relationships at any given moment, are killing the potential for genuine connection, but that would be lacking as an explanation. There are also countless marriages that started with a swipe. It\u2019s not the apps, it\u2019s the culture around the apps. The problem is people treating \u201cmatches,\u201d who are actually human beings with their own individual traits \u2014 which take time to learn and interpret, let alone appreciate \u2014 as disposable and interchangeable. Not the apps themselves. Spending my 20\u2019s in New York City, I watched all my friends engaging in marathon dating. They would meet someone on Monday, and someone new on Wednesday, but they were still \u201ctalking to\u201d someone from Thursday, and I\u2019d hear about Monday\u2019s date on Friday, but by Sunday, Wednesday\u2019s person had ghosted. I never remembered any names of the characters in their stories, I didn\u2019t need to bother trying to remember, anyway. There would just be a new Monday person, and a new Wednesday person, and a new person they were \u201ctalking to,\u201d next week. Take a look at the chat function in their dating app, the inbox looks something like this: Conversation A: Hey, what\u2019s up? Conversation B: Hey, what\u2019s up? Conversation C: Wyd Conversation D-L: Hey, what\u2019s up Conversation M: What are you up to this weekend? Conversation N: Hey, what are you up to tn Conversation O: Hey, wyd Repeat hundreds of times, for years \u2014 what McLeod was probably talking about when he describes \u201cburnout.\u201d If not burned out, then just bored to death. A bunch of my friends vowed off the apps forever. But then it was even harder to meet anyone. And you\u2019re back at square one, or square zero, and then you turn 28, and then you turn 30, and maybe you adopt a dog. So when I joined an app \u2014 Hinge, actually \u2014 when I was 25, I decided I would take a different tack. I got on the app and deleted it the same day. The plan was to meet one person. One. And go on a date with them. Maybe, hopefully, a few dates. But to delete the app when I had a first date set, and only download it again when I had decided it certainly wouldn\u2019t work with that person. That\u2019s it. No Monday person, no Wednesday person, no \u201ctalking to\u201d anyone else. One person at a time, even if there could be someone else available on Thursday. I was going to actually give the person I\u2019d meet a chance to have my attention. Another point on my plan was to never open a conversation with, \u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d I was going to only chat with someone who there was something to say to, based on the prompts on their profile. I would only speak to someone if I had something to say, or to ask, that I myself would like to read or respond to. So I started swiping, and a few minutes later I got a match. Profile included some nice photos, student at School of Visual Arts listed as occupation, keep scrolling, religion listed as Jewish, keep scrolling, profile says no drinking, no smoking, no drugs. \u201cWhat kind of artist has no vices,\u201d I opened a chat to ask. My phone buzzed a few minutes later, \u201cMy artistic inspiration comes by practicing mindfulness.\u201d I had just read about mindfulness, actually, in a Maimonides book, I wrote back. A date was set for 48 hours later in the next reply.

Apps aren\u2019t making people lonely. What is making so many people lonely is treating each other like there is a better, newer version of everyone you meet next week, and that no one is more than a two-dimensional profile on your screen. And that you, yourself, are a two-dimensional profile, and a photo, and a one sentence prompt, and all you have to say is, \u201cwyd.\u201d Dating apps are a revolutionary tool in dating and marriage. They\u2019re just being used wrong. What makes the online dating experience work is the same as what makes any relationship work no matter how it started: treating others, and yourself, as a serious and valued person. Use the apps, just reject the app culture. Emma-Jo Morris is the Politics Editor at Breitbart News. Email her at ejmorris@breitbart.com or follow her on Twitter ."
