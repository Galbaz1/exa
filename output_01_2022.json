Data2vec, a self-supervised model, learns from unlabeled data, inferring rules and structures similarly to human learning. It has shown competitive or superior performance compared to specialized models in tests, aiming to reduce reliance on labeled data significantly. This research, still in early stages, could lead to more generalized AI systems, understanding the world through a combination of senses.
