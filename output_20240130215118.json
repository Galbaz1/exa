    "question": "Why do we see ourselves in others, and even in other things.",
    "full_extract": "When you\u2019re working on your personal growth, you tend to focus excessively only on yourself. However, much of what you can learn is outside yourself or in your trusted environment. Indeed, since ancient times, there have been countless legends that tell us what we see in others reveals sacred information about who we are ourselves. There have been many psychological studies that affirm that your exterior acts as a mirror for your mind. A mirror in which you see different qualities, characteristics, and personal aspects of your own essence and of your most primitive being, reflected. In your everyday life, when you see something that you don\u2019t like in others, you tend to reject them or even feel disgusted. The law of mirroring claims that, in some way, an aspect that you dislike in another also exists within you. However, why does this happen? In this article, we\u2019ll explain. \u201cPeople reflect back to us the way we speak to them.\u201d -Laurent Gounelle- Is the flaw you see outside or in yourself? The law of mirroring establishes that your unconsciousness, aided by the psychological projection that you carry out at the time, makes you think that the flaw you perceive in others only exists \u2018out there\u2019, not in yourself. This psychological projection is a defense mechanism by which you attribute unacceptable feelings, thoughts, beliefs or even actions of your own to others. This psychological projection occurs during experiences that involve you in emotional conflict or when you feel threatened, both internally and externally. When your mind understands that there\u2019s a threat to your physical and emotional integrity, it tends to attribute them to an object or subject outside yourself. Therefore, you view them accordingly. Projections happen with both negative and positive experiences. You transfer your own reality without any filters to the outside world, building an external truth based on your own personal characteristics. One such experience of psychological projection happens when you fall in love and attribute to your loved one certain characteristics that only exist in you. You project your own reality onto your environment The law of mirroring is evident when you claim to \u2018know\u2019 other people very well. However, in reality, what you\u2019re doing is projecting your own reality onto them. When this situation occurs, you\u2019re superimposing your projected vision of yourself on the physical image of that person captured by your senses. Being aware of what you project onto others allows you to discover what you\u2019re really like. Allowing yourself to be aware of this mental mechanism makes it easier for you to regain control over what\u2019s happening inside you. Consequently, you\u2019re able to take charge and work on those aspects of yourself that you don\u2019t want to maintain or you want to transform to be positive. It\u2019s essential to remember that everything that comes to you via your senses you take to be true. However, you often don\u2019t recognize the role your own interpretation or subjectivity plays in this process. In fact, you live according to this way of perceiving reality, creating negative distortions that generate discomfort when interacting with the people around you, even with yourself. If you want to use this natural resource of projecting in a positive way to obtain healthy inner growth, meditation can help. That\u2019s because it makes it easier for you to learn to see things as they really are. Always keep in mind that \u2018observing says more about the observer than about who or what\u2019s being observed\u2019. \u201cWhat you see in other people is a reflection of yourself. A person of goodness sees goodness in others and a person of evil sees evil in others.\u201d -Omar Suleiman- How to use the law of mirroring to your advantage Do you want to take advantage of the law of mirroring in order to enhance your personal growth, self-knowledge, and to improve your personal relationships? If so, read on for a helpful exercise you can carry out. The first thing you should do is remember a time when you felt bad about something that happened with another person. For example, after having an argument. After that, ask yourself what that situation reflects in you. There are four possible alternatives : 1. The opposite It\u2019s often quite disturbing to interact with a person who\u2019s the complete opposite of you. For example, if you\u2019re really organized and are irritated by people who are messy and untidy it\u2019s possible that\u2019s what\u2019s really bothering you is that you\u2019re demanding too much of yourself in terms of organization. In this sense, you need to reflect. Ask yourself if you could be more flexible. Is it really so necessary to be so rigidly organized? If you stopped being so, would anything terrible happen? 2. Similarity Another possible scenario is that you see an element of you in the other person that you don\u2019t want to see. In other words, it\u2019s a part of you that you don\u2019t want to accept. If this is this case, you must reflect on what exactly it is that\u2019s hurting you about the other person. Then, consider whether you behave the same way in other situations. When you see it clearly, that part of you will stop fighting against your own shadow. It\u2019ll help you to change what you don\u2019t like. Bear in mind that, without acceptance, transformation isn\u2019t possible. 3. Selfish expectations When you have high expectations about a situation or person, and you begin to notice that they don\u2019t match reality, you begin to get upset. In these cases, you need to begin to accept that there\u2019ll always be situations that are beyond your control and that reality will never be as you want it to be. Coming to terms with this will take a huge weight off your shoulders. 4. Consider your actions When you find yourself feeling like you\u2019re a victim of the person who\u2019s hurting you, you don\u2019t realize that you\u2019re doing exactly the same thing to someone else. In these circumstances, you should reflect on the things that are making you feel bad about how you\u2019re treated, and think about them carefully. In fact, work out if you\u2019re acting in a similar way with someone else. This will certainly change your relationships with others for the better.It might interest you... https://www.theschooloflife.com/article/why-knowing-ourselves-is-impossible-and-necessary/ Why Knowing Ourselves is Impossible \u2013 and Necessary - The School of Life 2023-09-25 None One of the greater paradoxes of being human is that we must live within minds whose folds and depths we will never properly know. We, the most plausible experts on ourselves, are fated to go to our graves having made sense of only a slender portion of who we have been. Whole archives of sensations and thoughts, insights and intuitions will \u2013 at the end \u2013 dissolve away without record: the equivalent of the library of Alexandria going up in flames every time a ventilator is switched off. We dwell in a mansion made up of corridors, vaults and rooms, only a few of which we will be able to explore in the time that remains. We are armed with feeble flashlights with which to try to make sense of a vast darkness within us. J. M. W. Turner, Mountain Scene with Castle, 1802-3 Occasionally we pick up hints of how much might be at play in our minds. We wake up from a dream in which worlds and peoples we had no sense of knowing emerge with disorienting immediacy. Or, tossing fitfully in bed on a humid night, we collide against slices of our lives we had lost any active memory of: the light at dawn over the sea, a pair of gloves from early childhood, the light in the hallway when we took an ex-partner home for the first time two decades before, the seat of a taxi as we made our way across town on an autumn afternoon. None of it perhaps ever disappears. Unexpected bits of ourselves constantly surge up unbidden from certain sorts of biscuits, textures of carpet, smells and evening and morning lights. Our minds have been encoded over long years that we have no concrete recollection of. Just as we speak a language without any memory of its acquisition, so too the emotional forces that shaped our personalities grow invisible to us, leaving us their imprint but not their cast. The grounds for most of our responses lie outside of our understanding. If we were to pause and undertake the curious exercise of asking ourselves \u2013 with particular intent \u2013 what we were really feeling at a given moment, we might become conscious of an implausibly broad and simultaneous array of concerns and feelings. We might, for example, have a concurrent sense that we have an appointment at midday, that there is a slight scab on our right hand, that we\u2019re under the pall of a tetchy exchange several hours before with our partner, that the words of a maddening song are playing somewhere in us (\u2018Because only you belong\u2026ahhah\u2026 because only you belong\u2026 ahhah\u2019), that we\u2019re starting to apprehend an anxiety around a meeting tomorrow, that we miss M. and the playfulness of the other night, that the arch of our foot aches uncomfortably, that we\u2019ve been left guilty by an article in the paper, that there\u2019s someone bouncing a ball outside, that the colour of the vitamin packet on the desk is exactly that of the cupboard in our classroom in primary school, that a colleague was strangely abrupt with us on Friday, that we have to pick up on a pair of trousers from the dry cleaner\u2019s after we\u2019ve had lunch, that there is a strange-sounding bird squawking outside, that we\u2019d like to stretch our back, that there is something almost religious waiting to emerge inside us\u2026 And this, of course, is only a ridiculously curtailed summary of what might really be going on at any specific point. Rather than attempting to describe it in linear prose, it might be better to resort to a gigantic map of the kind they use to represent the stars, in which all the elements of consciousness might be pictured like so many galaxies and constellations, some near, others many light years away, in the boundless sky of the inner mind. Partly we\u2019re encouraged to miss some of our own intricacy because we take our cue from other people and they, from the outside, appear so much simpler than they are. The human face is a misleading organ which doesn\u2019t let on about the hesitancy, richness, confusion, genius, muddle and obscurity within. The eyes don\u2019t hint at the torrent of images we see whenever we close them, the mouth doesn\u2019t reveal the polyphonic internal murmur we hear whenever we are in silence. In company, people speak in more or less meaningful sentences; they lift out of their streams of consciousness a few relatively upbeat and comprehensible phrases. In response to a question as to how they are, they\u2019ll say: \u2018Oh not too bad, all things considered\u2026\u2019 They\u2019ll let us know that they had \u2018a quiet weekend,\u2019 or are \u2018going to take a few days off to see mum.\u2019 And we start to forget what kind of brutal summaries these are. We don\u2019t accord to other people the knowledge we have from inside ourselves, namely that, we contain worlds. Novelists further rush over the subtleties, and help us to forget who we are, by writing sentences like: \u2018Amanda decided she needed to end her relationship.\u2019 Or: \u2018Abdul realised he was after a change of career\u2019 \u2013 as though any real human has ever thought in such clear-cut and purposive ways. The difficulty we have in understanding ourselves is not merely an intellectual puzzle; it\u2019s what ends up powering our greatest psychic pains. It\u2019s because we have such trouble working out what we feel, who we are, what we want, and what is motivating us that we end up marrying the wrong people, pursuing unfulfilling careers, failing to connect properly with friends, spending our money inappropriately, squabbling with innocent colleagues and passing on a raft of our problems to the next generation. We grow beset by foreboding that we can\u2019t trace back to anything concrete. Or we feel hemmed in, unfree and burdened by a weight of unthought thoughts, uninterpreted emotions, and unfelt feelings. It\u2019s because of our self-ignorance that we can\u2019t determine whether we\u2019re feeling love or obsession, that we can\u2019t work out the origins of our anxieties and surprise ourselves with the extent of our irritability or rage when we lose our sunglasses or the sellotape isn\u2019t where we expected it to be. The mind tries to give us signs when we are failing to understand it as well as it requires. It sends us headaches to stir our consciences, it emits twitches and neurotic compulsions; we find we can\u2019t sleep or develop addictions to exercise, drugs or the news. We suffer the mind\u2019s desperate and creative revenge for all the thoughts we have refused to entertain. If we are fortunate, we can find encouragement to interrupt our mania, we may pause, take a week off, travel somewhere remote \u2013 and start the arduous business of looking inside. We can wonder why things are not as straightforward as we had imagined: why our relationships keep failing, why our back is so tense, why sleep never comes and why we are so scared of disaster. When Socrates, apparently the wisest man of antiquity, was asked to define our highest purpose as humans, he offered a still-legendary answer: \u2018To know ourselves.\u2019 Without self-knowledge, all other efforts will be in vain. It won\u2019t matter how much money we have or what achievements we have pulled off or how many friends we can lay claim to, there will be unexplained despair and nightmares. That the task of self-knowledge is fated to remain incomplete is no argument against it; it is the dedication that counts. We should aspire to be people who never cease to try to make sense of themselves, who want to be able to answer how their childhoods have shaped them, what their attachment style is or where reality ends and their projections begin. It\u2019s a mark of maturity not to be offended or thrown off course by someone who asks us for more information on how we might be complicated or \u2018a bit mad\u2019, given that we all are, and that the closest any of us ever come to sanity is to intuit some of the ways in which we might be unwell. We should devote ourselves to constantly trying to shrink the scale of the darkness within us; bringing what was once in shadow closer to the light of interpretation, so that we stand a chance of being slightly less frantic, intemperate and unpredictable to others and ourselves. J. M. W. Turner, Mountain Scene with Village and Castle, 1799 The prerequisites for the task of self-knowledge are patience, guile and limitless humility. We\u2019ll need to call on some of the remorselessness of an angler and the persistence of a lepidopterist. We\u2019ll need to catch ourselves unawares: we\u2019ll need to be curious in the early hours after waking up from a dream, or in twilight moods of tiredness when our defences are low and our true yearnings can be felt twitching in the background or on long quiet evenings when we can sift through thoughts and ideas without censorship or concern for being normal. If we are fortunate and devoted, gradually, we may start to lay claim to certain insights. Sections of the map can be filled in; we\u2019ll have a sense of what our childhoods did to us, what exaggerated fears and behaviours we may be carrying, what unhelpful things we do when people love us (and when they don\u2019t), why we fall into moods at specific times of the day. There may \u2013 thanks to long years of work \u2013 be a more reliable connection between what we consciously register and what is really at happening in us. We\u2019ll know where a mood of persecution is coming from, we\u2019ll be able to trace a link between the unfriendly conversation yesterday and the feeling of shame today. The quality of our detective work will rise. We may shorten the distance between feeling and expression; understand a little more of what we want and what we might be suited to, piece together why we are tricky around certain people who appear to remind us of characters from our pasts, apprehend what games we are trying to invite people to play with us who don\u2019t deserve or want them, recognise the history of moods and tendencies that hold us back and discern why we might be compelled to fail or hurt ourselves. We will \u2013 with greater self-knowledge \u2013 be better able to apologise where appropriate, we\u2019ll be less in need of defensive strategies, we\u2019ll be able to admit to more and to deny less, we\u2019ll be more stable and funnier because we\u2019ll have a better hold on our contradictions and the gulf between who we hope to be and who we are. Modern society gives us no shortage of ambitions. We will have landed on the option with the best chance of bringing us peace and freedom when we can dare to begin the inward journey. ||||I|||| * Therapy Psychotherapy + Therapy Retreats + Career Counselling + Couples Therapy + All Therapy Services * Shop Shop + New In + Best Sellers + Books + Games & Card Sets + Gift Sets + For Children + View All * App * Articles * At Work At Work + Who We Are + What We Offer + Our Clients + Contact Us + Brand Partnerships + Open Enrolment * About Us About Us + Contact + Hear from Us * Location Global + Amsterdam + Berlin + Paris + Sao Paulo + Global * Login/Signup Login * Menu * Global * Login/Signup * Location + Amsterdam + Berlin + Paris + Sao Paulo + Global * Therapy Psychotherapy + Therapy Retreats + Career Counselling + Couples Therapy + All Therapy Services * Shop Shop + New In + Best Sellers + Books + Games & Card Sets + Gift Sets + For Children + View All * App * Articles * At Work At Work + Who We Are + What We Offer + Our Clients + Contact Us + Brand Partnerships + Open Enrolment * About Us About Us + Contact + Hear from Us View all themes * View All Themes * Self-Knowledge * Relationships * Sociability * Work * Calm * Leisure Full Article Index Page views 4985 Share Self-Knowledge \u2022 Know Yourself Share Why Knowing Ourselves is Impossible \u2013 and Necessary One of the greater paradoxes of being human is that we must live within minds whose folds and depths we will never properly know.

A mountain range has little in common with a family; the design of a city is nothing like a colleague \u2013 or so it seems. But if that is true, then why do we use spatial and architectural metaphors to describe so many of our human relationships? Good, trusted friends are described as \u2018close\u2019, regardless of their physical proximity, and a loved one on the other side of the world may feel \u2018nearer\u2019 to you than someone you live with. You might have an \u2018inner circle\u2019 of friends or feel \u2018left out\u2019 from the circles of others. A colleague with \u2018higher\u2019 status may seem to be \u2018above\u2019 you and those with \u2018lower\u2019 status may be \u2018below\u2019. There is even something architectural about the way we speak of \u2018setting boundaries\u2019 or \u2018walling Without much thought, we employ a whole library of spatial and architectural metaphors to explain our social worlds \u2013 and not just for our personal relationships. These metaphors are foundational for social thought at the societal level, too. We describe some groups of people as \u2018marginalised\u2019 (pushed aside) or \u2018oppressed\u2019 (pushed down), and society itself is said to have a \u2018structure\u2019 to it, as though it were assembled like a skyscraper. Why do social relationships form distinct geometries in our minds? In the past few decades, research has shown that these metaphors are not merely idiosyncratic uses of language. Instead, they reveal something fundamentally spatial about how we experience our social lives. And this leads to a radical possibility: if we make sense of our friendships, acquaintances, colleagues, families and societies through spatial relationships, could architectural concepts \u2013 the intentional design of space \u2013 become tools for creating new metaphors for social and political thought? n the past 40 years, psychologists and linguists have demonstrated that these spatial metaphors are indeed more-than-metaphoric. In the 1980s, the philosopher George Lakoff and the cognitive linguist Mark Johnson showed that metaphors referencing bodily experiences in space structure how we think and speak about abstract social ideas: in English, love is sometimes expressed as a \u2018journey\u2019; the truth is something we \u2018see clearly\u2019. But it wasn\u2019t until the mid-2000s that Lakoff and the neuroscientist Vittorio Gallese began to more boldly assert that the bodily states referenced in metaphors, such as \u2018love is a journey\u2019, involve simulations of the same sensation and perception networks engaged when those states \u2013 in this case, travelling \u2013 were first experienced. This means that, when we describe our extroverted friend as \u2018lighting up the room\u2019, the same part of the brain that tracks luminance levels in our environment (the visual cortex) reactivates during metaphor comprehension to simulate an image of a room lighting up, helping us understand an otherwise abstract comment about someone\u2019s \u2018bright\u2019 personality. \u2018Imagining and doing,\u2019 Gallese and Lakoff have suggested, \u2018use a shared neural substrate.\u2019 (In other words, \u2018thought is an exploitation of the normal operations of our bodies.\u2019) Embodied experiences with objects in physical space seem to provide helpful conceptual structures that we map onto our relationships. Spatial metaphors are the result of this process. We all have first-hand experiences of interacting with objects in space. We have reached out to grab something on a table in front of us, moved to catch something flying in the air, and failed to grasp something beyond our reach. Using these embodied experiences of proximity as reference points, our brains simulate the positions of people as \u2018near\u2019 or \u2018far\u2019 in an imagined \u2018social space\u2019. But how deep does the relationship between our spatial experiences and social worlds really go? Is there really a neural substrate that links our experiences of mountains and families or cities and colleagues? If we describe someone as \u2018distant\u2019, we think of them in that spatial term, even if they\u2019re next to us At the start of this century, cognitive scientists began charting the psychological geometries of social space using carefully controlled experiments. These experiments asked whether the \u2018distances\u2019 we apply to other people in our imagined social worlds \u2013 thinking of a friend as close or of an acquaintance as distant \u2013 manifest in our behaviour toward those people. In one study, participants were asked to draw the route they would take to deliver a package along an path that passed by three figures. The three figures were described as \u2018friends\u2019 to one group and \u2018strangers\u2019 to another. Participants in the \u2018friends\u2019 group drew lines along the path that were significantly closer to the figures compared with the lines drawn by participants in the \u2018strangers\u2019 group. The researchers reasoned that the effect was due to implicit associations between spatial proximity and friendship: distance was associated with strangers; closeness with friends. In another study, Americans who held negative opinions about Mexico overestimated the distance between American and Mexican cities compared with Americans who held more positive views of Mexico. The authors of this study reasoned that distance estimations in the physical world were affected by how participants positioned Mexico in an imagined social space. The spatial metaphors we use to describe social relations aren\u2019t just idiosyncratic uses of language, but reflections of how those social relations are structured in our minds. When we describe someone as \u2018distant\u2019 or \u2018out of touch\u2019, we really think of them in those spatial terms, even if they are standing next o navigate the world, we rely on mental representations of where things are and how to interact with them. This is similar to the way that social information is conceptually represented: knowing where people are located in terms of affiliation and power is central to social functioning and helps us navigate our daily interactions. For cognitive neuroscientists, both operations share a similar phenomenology because we subjectively experience both \u2018mapping\u2019 tasks in similar ways. That is why mapping social content in a mental \u2018space\u2019 feels as intuitive as the mapping involved in geographic or architectural work. However, it is not just that we use spatial experiences to make sense of social relationships. These effects also work in the other direction. We seem to process social content differently based on where it is located in the world. In one study, participants were shown pairs of \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018low\u2019 power words, such as \u2018master\u2019 and \u2018servant\u2019, on a screen. Through different exercises, the vertical positions of these words were altered so that each had a chance to appear above and below the other. The study found that participants recognised high-power nouns, like \u2018master\u2019, more quickly than low-power nouns, like \u2018servant\u2019, when they appeared above but not when they appeared below. Another study placed the words \u2018friend\u2019 and \u2018enemy\u2019 in different locations \u2013 near and far \u2013 on a 3D graphic, and found that the word \u2018friend\u2019 was recognised faster than the word \u2018enemy\u2019 when placed closer, while the word \u2018enemy\u2019 was recognised faster when it was placed far away. In both studies, researchers reasoned that the recognition of certain socially charged words improved when located in positions congruent with participants\u2019 spatial representations of those social concepts. This allowed participants to process the words more rapidly. There is a common cortical basis for spatial cognition and social cognition Based on this evidence of a strong relationship between spatial and social cognition, you may assume that Gallese and Lakoff\u2019s prediction was correct: there really are shared neural substrates for both types of thought. The research of cognitive neuroscientists seems to support this prediction. In one study from 2014, researchers tracked the brain activity of participants who were shown images of objects in different locations on a table. Participants were asked to judge whether an object was \u2018closer\u2019 or \u2018farther\u2019 from another object depicted in each image. Researchers recorded brain activity during these judgments and trained a machine-learning algorithm to decode and classify the data associated with both near and far distance judgments. Eventually, the algorithm could reliably determine whether the participant was making a near or far distance judgment just by analysing their brain activity. Next, participants were asked to provide photographs of eight people in their social circles: four people they had a strong relationship with, and four people whom they knew but were not close to. Researchers measured the brain activity of participants while asking whether the person shown in each photograph was a \u2018friend\u2019 or \u2018acquaintance\u2019. The researchers referred to this task as the \u2018social distance\u2019 judgment task. Instead of looking for overlap in brain activity between the two tasks, researchers used the trained algorithm from the spatial distance task to decode the data from the social distance task. The spatial algorithm was able, with above-chance accuracy, to predict participants\u2019 responses to the social distance task. In other words, brain activity in one part of the brain associated with \u2018near\u2019 and \u2018far\u2019 spatial distance judgments \u2013 in this case, the inferior parietal lobule \u2013 could be used as a template to predict social distance judgments. This finding supports the claim that there is a common cortical basis for spatial cognition and social cognition. That friend who is \u2018close\u2019 to you, even if they live on the other side of the world, is being mapped by the same part of the brain that has determined you are \u2018close\u2019 to the screen you are using to read this essay. o, what are the explanations of this? Some researchers argue that social cognition is an \u2018exaptation\u2019 of spatial cognition. An exaptation is a secondary use for an original adaptation. The most famous example of exaptation, first proposed by Charles Darwin, are the lungs found in all air-breathing animals. Rather than suggesting this organ evolved to intake oxygen, Darwin believed the lungs \u2018exapted\u2019 from the internal swim bladders of fish \u2013 a gas-filled organ that allows fish to control their buoyancy underwater. In the case of social cognition, some neuroscientists have argued that the neural systems for spatial cognition were \u2018upcycled\u2019 to form the basis of social cognition. This allowed social information to be organised in an orderly, dimensional manner, where individuals can be represented as coordinates in a topographical \u2018space\u2019 from which inferences can be generated, similar to how spatial information is represented. Exaptation is a more parsimonious explanation for the development of two distinct but highly related brain functions, in comparison with an evolutionary explanation that suggests the independent development of two completely modular brain areas. If social and spatial cognition are truly hardwired together in the brain, as this argument suggests, that would explain our ability to immediately infer someone\u2019s social status by perceiving their spatial position in social settings. It\u2019s a provocative argument, but one that requires more research to validate. Jacobins sat on the left side of the king, while members of the Royalists sat to his right Importantly, this argument does not claim that social cognition can be reduced to spatial cognition. Other research from social psychology has demonstrated that our mental representations of people are multimodal. They include emotional associations, declarative knowledge and episodic memories, among other content. But, at the very least, this argument offers a plausible explanation for how we first acquired, and how we still experience, one of the most fundamental aspects of human cognition: our thoughts about other people. The broader implications of this idea force us to consider more deeply how the spaces we design reflect our implicit spatial associations with different groups of people, including friends, family, communities, and societies. Moreover, given that the spatial world can profoundly alter our social cognition, could architecture and other forms of spatial design act as conceptual tools for constructing new forms of social thought? Opening of the Estates-General in Versailles 5 May 1789, engraving (1790) by Isidore Stanislas Helman. Courtesy Wikipedia In fact, it has already happened. In the three estates of French society \u2013 the clergy, nobility and commoners \u2013 gathered in Versailles to debate the levying of new taxes and to undertake reforms in the country. This event marked the turn towards democracy as the dominant system of political governance in France, as well as in much of the rest of Europe soon after. It was not only the ideas debated at this event that proved historic, but also the arrangement of those ideas in space. In attendance were members of the Jacobin party, the anti-royalists who campaigned to abolish the monarchy and implement liberal policies. It just so happened that they sat on the left side of the king, while members of the Royalists, the party that wanted to conserve the monarchy and its power, sat to the king\u2019s right. This seating arrangement stuck, and instead of referring to the names of either party, a spatial metaphor \u2013 \u2018left\u2019 and \u2018right\u2019 \u2013 could be used to distinguish between the two groups. Jacobins, the group that advocated for liberal policies, were on the \u2018Left\u2019; Royalists, those that advocated for conservative policies, on the \u2018Right\u2019. This spatialisation of political groups endures today, even though the seating arrangement in which it was founded is now mostly forgotten and certainly abandoned \u2013 political parties no longer seat themselves on either side of a monarch. The origin story of the Left-Right political spectrum demonstrates the role that organising different social groups in space can have on how those groups are represented mentally. The effect of this mental representation on subsequent political thought cannot be understated. Today, more than two centuries later, there is no political party, politician or even political idea that isn\u2019t positioned somewhere along the Left-Right political spectrum. The fact that the spatial relationship that this spectrum is based upon was initially arbitrary makes it even more remarkable. f an arbitrary spatial configuration of people in space could have such a profound impact on the structure of political thought, could we take more deliberate control of these effects? Architecture offers a multitude of possible spatial configurations. The spaces architects design for different people can be tall, wide, open, confined, with or without views \u2013 each is a proposition for social thought. This is why we put those who win athletic competitions on the highest podium, why bosses of organisations often occupy the largest offices on the uppermost floors of buildings; why the heads of families traditionally slept in the \u2018master bedroom\u2019 and ate at the head of the table. Across these cases, power is constituted by being above, in the centre, having more space (or a better view). The \u2018maternal arms of Mother Church\u2019; the Piazza San Pietro in Rome. Courtesy Wikipedia Architecture has often been used as a tool to communicate specific narratives about social relations and distributions of power. Monumental structures like the Pyramids of Giza, the Forbidden City in Beijing, the Parthenon in Athens, or the Arc de Triomphe in Paris manipulate height, distance, mass, volume and boundaries to reify otherwise abstract ideas about power. Take, for example, Basilica at the Vatican. Built during the 16th and it broke away from traditional architectural standards for Catholic churches by donating a significant amount of space to the public in the form of the Piazza San Pietro, which can host hundreds of thousands of worshippers at one time. Instead of a square, Piazza San Pietro was designed as an oval surrounded by an open-air colonnade four rows deep. In the words of its architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini, the piazza embraces visitors in the \u2018braccia materne della Chiesa\u2019 (the \u2018maternal arms of Mother Church\u2019). It had to do so. After all, Basilica was built during the Protestant Reformation, a time when the authority of the Catholic Church in Rome \u2013 which appeared so removed from the concerns of the public \u2013 was questioned by Protestant Reformers in northern Europe. In response, the Roman Catholic Church embarked on its own Counter-Reformation, which involved dissolving its own nepotistic and corrupt practices and turning its attention back toward the people, including through the architecture at the Vatican. The spatial design of the Piazza San Pietro allowed the Catholic Church to signal a new era of social transparency and openness. The architectural metaphor of the \u2018glass ceiling\u2019 expresses the barriers often invisible But one needs not be an architect to alter collective social thought. Even architectural or spatial metaphors can produce an effect. Advocates for social progress, whether they are fighting against inequality, oppression or an erosion of rights, often ground their social experiences in spatial metaphors as they defend those who are \u2018marginalised\u2019, \u2018oppressed\u2019 or \u2018subjugated\u2019. For this reason, social justice movements often feature metaphors of occupation and agency in space. In 1929, one year after women had won the right to vote in Britain, Virginia Woolf used an architectural metaphor \u2013 of One\u2019s Own \u2013 as the title of her feminist essay arguing for women\u2019s intellectual agency. The \u2018room\u2019 in question can be interpreted both literally and metaphorically. In literal terms, Woolf writes that \u2018a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.\u2019 Private spaces for writing or study would have been luxuries for many women in the early But the title\u2019s full import is best understood as a metaphor that expresses the right of women to uninterrupted and self-driven intellectual pursuits \u2013 an idea Woolf explores throughout her essay. Today, feminists use the architectural metaphor of the \u2018glass ceiling\u2019 to express the barriers often invisible to men (hence \u2018glass\u2019) that women experience as they climb the corporate ladder. Similarly, members of the LGBTQ+ community are encouraged to \u2018come out of the closet\u2019 to become socially visible. More recently, at the 2020 George Floyd protests, the call-and-response cry \u2018Whose streets? Our streets!\u2019 was used to communicate the unmet right of racial minorities to feel safe in public spaces. Like Woolf\u2019s title, these expressions can be interpreted literally, but their full effect is best understood metaphorically. As spatial metaphors, they help describe how minority groups experience and seek to overcome social barriers. Without these metaphors, it can be very difficult to express, for example, the feelings of social isolation and constraint that members of the LGBTQ+ community experience from hiding their gender identity or sexual orientation. Through spatial metaphor, non-group members can understand the feelings of social isolation and constraint of a life lived \u2018in the closet\u2019. Even the Left-Right political spectrum, which seems to lead toward political extremism, can be reconstructed using novel spatial metaphors. Spatial metaphors like \u2018partisan\u2019, \u2018polarised\u2019 or \u2018extremist\u2019 are often used to describe individuals who hold the strongest political views. These spatial metaphors generate meaning by referencing positions along a horizontal line with poles extending in opposite directions. But what if, rather than a straight line, we positioned political opinions on a horseshoe? First coined in 2002 by the French philosopher Jean-Pierre Faye, \u2018horseshoe theory\u2019 has been debated by political theorists since the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, a treaty of non-aggression signed in 1939 between Hitler\u2019s Nazi government and Stalin\u2019s Communist Party. Since then, the theory has been used to explain, among other things, the fact that cent of people who voted for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primaries voted for Donald Trump in the presidential election, arguably costing the \u2018Left-leaning\u2019 candidate, Hillary Clinton, the election. Another example is that politicians and pundits on both the far-Left and far-Right have advocated anti-interventionist positions regarding the war in Ukraine. But that\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t massive ideological differences between far-Left and far-Right political positions. Like the simple binary of the Left-Right spectrum, political theorists have argued that horseshoe theory also overly simplifies the ideological landscape. What is clear, though, is that novel spatial metaphors offer alternative forms to what are otherwise restrictively linear forms of political thought. he possibilities of rethinking the shapes of social thought may seem vast. But spatial metaphors don\u2019t always liberate. As is the case with a rigid conceptualisation of the Left-Right spectrum, sometimes they place constraints on social thought. The titles given to authority figures in our social and political institutions, such as \u2018Headmaster\u2019, \u2018Your Highness\u2019 or \u2018Supreme Court\u2019, often reference spatial conditions of height and mass. Even the title \u2018President\u2019 can be decomposed to a spatial metaphor: from the Latin praesident (\u2018sitting before\u2019). \u2018Highness\u2019; The Coronation of Emperor Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna (1898) by Laurits Tuxen. Hermitage Museum/Wikipedia For this reason, it\u2019s important to tune our ears to the spatial and architectural metaphors that may be constraining our interpersonal relations and political discourse. These metaphors can indicate growing mental divisions between social groups. Consider Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and his rhetoric about building a wall along the southern US border. While some new border fencing was built during Trump\u2019s presidency, the former president\u2019s proposal to build an impenetrable wall is best understood as a metaphor that signalled a wider shift toward an isolationist stance in foreign policy and immigration. Metaphorical barriers remain standing long after their physical referents are demolished Similarly, for many people, the Great Wall of China marks a clear distinction between the Chinese nation to the south and marauding barbarians to the north. This idea endures, even if this literal wall has always been, in fact, a collection of many lesser walls \u2013 a porous physical reality that belies the monumentality of the metaphor. In Germany, citizens continue to overestimate distances between cities that were on the other side of what was the Iron Curtain, in comparison with cities on the same side before reunification. Further, these overestimations are greater for citizens with more negative attitudes toward reunification, compared with those of citizens who had positive views. Metaphorical barriers remain standing long after their physical referents are demolished. For millennia, architects have designed buildings with spatial forms that far exceeded the functional needs of their occupants. Instead, they often sought to create structures that would be understood as metaphors for social power. Similarly, writers, activists and politicians have relied on spatial and architectural metaphors to communicate their social experiences and desires. Recent cognitive neuroscience research shows that there is a neurobiological basis for both effects. This mechanism provides insight into the phenomenology, the subjectivity, of social experience, but it should also lead us to carefully consider what our movements and positions in space say about our social agency and status. Equally, it could lead to an understanding of how the architecture built for people in cities reflects the spatial distances implicitly attributed to them. Insight isn\u2019t all. There are also radical possibilities in social-spatial thought. Through this mechanism we can become architects of our collective experiences, building new metaphors for social life and shaping the geometries of other people in our minds.||||I|||| \u00d7 CLOSE PhilosophySciencePsychologySocietyCulture EssaysVideosAudio Popular About DonateNewsletter Menu Donate Newsletter SIGN IN Outing with Friends to the Coast (1949).

A mountain range has little in common with a family; the design of a city is nothing like a colleague \u2013 or so it seems. But if that is true, then why do we use spatial and architectural metaphors to describe so many of our human relationships? Good, trusted friends are described as \u2018close\u2019, regardless of their physical proximity, and a loved one on the other side of the world may feel \u2018nearer\u2019 to you than someone you live with. You might have an \u2018inner circle\u2019 of friends or feel \u2018left out\u2019 from the circles of others. A colleague with \u2018higher\u2019 status may seem to be \u2018above\u2019 you and those with \u2018lower\u2019 status may be \u2018below\u2019. There is even something architectural about the way we speak of \u2018setting boundaries\u2019 or \u2018walling someone off\u2019.

This means that, when we describe our extroverted friend as \u2018lighting up the room\u2019, the same part of the brain that tracks luminance levels in our environment (the visual cortex) reactivates during metaphor comprehension to simulate an image of a room lighting up, helping us understand an otherwise abstract comment about someone\u2019s \u2018bright\u2019 personality. \u2018Imagining and doing,\u2019 Gallese and Lakoff have suggested, \u2018use a shared neural substrate.\u2019 (In other words, \u2018thought is an exploitation of the normal operations of our bodies.\u2019) Embodied experiences with objects in physical space seem to provide helpful conceptual structures that we map onto our relationships.

But how deep does the relationship between our spatial experiences and social worlds really go? Is there really a neural substrate that links our experiences of mountains and families or cities and colleagues? If we describe someone as \u2018distant\u2019, we think of them in that spatial term, even if they\u2019re next to us At the start of this century, cognitive scientists began charting the psychological geometries of social space using carefully controlled experiments. These experiments asked whether the \u2018distances\u2019 we apply to other people in our imagined social worlds \u2013 thinking of a friend as close or of an acquaintance as distant \u2013 manifest in our behaviour toward those people. In one study, participants were asked to draw the route they would take to deliver a package along an S-shaped path that passed by three figures. The three figures were described as \u2018friends\u2019 to one group and \u2018strangers\u2019 to another. Participants in the \u2018friends\u2019 group drew lines along the path that were significantly closer to the figures compared with the lines drawn by participants in the \u2018strangers\u2019 group.

There is a common cortical basis for spatial cognition and social cognition Based on this evidence of a strong relationship between spatial and social cognition, you may assume that Gallese and Lakoff\u2019s prediction was correct: there really are shared neural substrates for both types of thought. The research of cognitive neuroscientists seems to support this prediction. In one study from 2014, researchers tracked the brain activity of participants who were shown images of objects in different locations on a table. Participants were asked to judge whether an object was \u2018closer\u2019 or \u2018farther\u2019 from another object depicted in each image. Researchers recorded brain activity during these judgments and trained a machine-learning algorithm to decode and classify the data associated with both near and far distance judgments. Eventually, the algorithm could reliably determine whether the participant was making a near or far distance judgment just by analysing their brain activity. Next, participants were asked to provide photographs of eight people in their social circles: four people they had a strong relationship with, and four people whom they knew but were not close to. Researchers measured the brain activity of participants while asking whether the person shown in each photograph was a \u2018friend\u2019 or \u2018acquaintance\u2019. The researchers referred to this task as the \u2018social distance\u2019 judgment task. Instead of looking for overlap in brain activity between the two tasks, researchers used the trained algorithm from the spatial distance task to decode the data from the social distance task. The spatial algorithm was able, with above-chance accuracy, to predict participants\u2019 responses to the social distance task. In other words, brain activity in one part of the brain associated with \u2018near\u2019 and \u2018far\u2019 spatial distance judgments \u2013 in this case, the inferior parietal lobule \u2013 could be used as a template to predict social distance judgments. This finding supports the claim that there is a common cortical basis for spatial cognition and social cognition. That friend who is \u2018close\u2019 to you, even if they live on the other side of the world, is being mapped by the same part of the brain that has determined you are \u2018close\u2019 to the screen you are using to read this essay. S o, what are the explanations of this? Some researchers argue that social cognition is an \u2018exaptation\u2019 of spatial cognition. An exaptation is a secondary use for an original adaptation. The most famous example of exaptation, first proposed by Charles Darwin, are the lungs found in all air-breathing animals. Rather than suggesting this organ evolved to intake oxygen, Darwin believed the lungs \u2018exapted\u2019 from the internal swim bladders of fish \u2013 a gas-filled organ that allows fish to control their buoyancy underwater. In the case of social cognition, some neuroscientists have argued that the neural systems for spatial cognition were \u2018upcycled\u2019 to form the basis of social cognition. This allowed social information to be organised in an orderly, dimensional manner, where individuals can be represented as coordinates in a topographical \u2018space\u2019 from which inferences can be generated, similar to how spatial information is represented. Exaptation is a more parsimonious explanation for the development of two distinct but highly related brain functions, in comparison with an evolutionary explanation that suggests the independent development of two completely modular brain areas. If social and spatial cognition are truly hardwired together in the brain, as this argument suggests, that would explain our ability to immediately infer someone\u2019s social status by perceiving their spatial position in social settings. It\u2019s a provocative argument, but one that requires more research to validate. Jacobins sat on the left side of the king, while members of the Royalists sat to his right Importantly, this argument does not claim that social cognition can be reduced to spatial cognition. Other research from social psychology has demonstrated that our mental representations of people are multimodal. They include emotional associations, declarative knowledge and episodic memories, among other content. But, at the very least, this argument offers a plausible explanation for how we first acquired, and how we still experience, one of the most fundamental aspects of human cognition: our thoughts about other people. The broader implications of this idea force us to consider more deeply how the spaces we design reflect our implicit spatial associations with different groups of people, including friends, family, communities, and societies. Moreover, given that the spatial world can profoundly alter our social cognition, could architecture and other forms of spatial design act as conceptual tools for constructing new forms of social thought? Opening of the Estates-General in Versailles 5 May 1789, engraving (1790) by Isidore Stanislas Helman. Courtesy Wikipedia In fact, it has already happened. In May 1789, the three estates of French society \u2013 the clergy, nobility and commoners \u2013 gathered in Versailles to debate the levying of new taxes and to undertake reforms in the country. This event marked the turn towards democracy as the dominant system of political governance in France, as well as in much of the rest of Europe soon after. It was not only the ideas debated at this event that proved historic, but also the arrangement of those ideas in space. In attendance were members of the Jacobin party, the anti-royalists who campaigned to abolish the monarchy and implement liberal policies. It just so happened that they sat on the left side of the king, while members of the Royalists, the party that wanted to conserve the monarchy and its power, sat to the king\u2019s right. This seating arrangement stuck, and instead of referring to the names of either party, a spatial metaphor \u2013 \u2018left\u2019 and \u2018right\u2019 \u2013 could be used to distinguish between the two groups. Jacobins, the group that advocated for liberal policies, were on the \u2018Left\u2019; Royalists, those that advocated for conservative policies, on the \u2018Right\u2019. This spatialisation of political groups endures today, even though the seating arrangement in which it was founded is now mostly forgotten and certainly abandoned \u2013 political parties no longer seat themselves on either side of a monarch. The origin story of the Left-Right political spectrum demonstrates the role that organising different social groups in space can have on how those groups are represented mentally. The effect of this mental representation on subsequent political thought cannot be understated. Today, more than two centuries later, there is no political party, politician or even political idea that isn\u2019t positioned somewhere along the Left-Right political spectrum. The fact that the spatial relationship that this spectrum is based upon was initially arbitrary makes it even more remarkable. I f an arbitrary spatial configuration of people in space could have such a profound impact on the structure of political thought, could we take more deliberate control of these effects? Architecture offers a multitude of possible spatial configurations. The spaces architects design for different people can be tall, wide, open, confined, with or without views \u2013 each is a proposition for social thought. This is why we put those who win athletic competitions on the highest podium, why bosses of organisations often occupy the largest offices on the uppermost floors of buildings; why the heads of families traditionally slept in the \u2018master bedroom\u2019 and ate at the head of the table. Across these cases, power is constituted by being above, in the centre, having more space (or a better view). The \u2018maternal arms of Mother Church\u2019; the Piazza San Pietro in Rome. Courtesy Wikipedia Architecture has often been used as a tool to communicate specific narratives about social relations and distributions of power. Monumental structures like the Pyramids of Giza, the Forbidden City in Beijing, the Parthenon in Athens, or the Arc de Triomphe in Paris manipulate height, distance, mass, volume and boundaries to reify otherwise abstract ideas about power. Take, for example, St Peter\u2019s Basilica at the Vatican. Built during the 16th and 17th centuries, it broke away from traditional architectural standards for Catholic churches by donating a significant amount of space to the public in the form of the Piazza San Pietro, which can host hundreds of thousands of worshippers at one time. Instead of a square, Piazza San Pietro was designed as an oval surrounded by an open-air colonnade four rows deep. In the words of its architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini, the piazza embraces visitors in the \u2018braccia materne della Chiesa\u2019 (the \u2018maternal arms of Mother Church\u2019). It had to do so. After all, St Peter\u2019s Basilica was built during the Protestant Reformation, a time when the authority of the Catholic Church in Rome \u2013 which appeared so removed from the concerns of the public \u2013 was questioned by Protestant Reformers in northern Europe. In response, the Roman Catholic Church embarked on its own Counter-Reformation, which involved dissolving its own nepotistic and corrupt practices and turning its attention back toward the people, including through the architecture at the Vatican. The spatial design of the Piazza San Pietro allowed the Catholic Church to signal a new era of social transparency and openness. The architectural metaphor of the \u2018glass ceiling\u2019 expresses the barriers often invisible to men But one needs not be an architect to alter collective social thought. Even architectural or spatial metaphors can produce an effect. Advocates for social progress, whether they are fighting against inequality, oppression or an erosion of rights, often ground their social experiences in spatial metaphors as they defend those who are \u2018marginalised\u2019, \u2018oppressed\u2019 or \u2018subjugated\u2019. For this reason, social justice movements often feature metaphors of occupation and agency in space. In 1929, one year after women had won the right to vote in Britain, Virginia Woolf used an architectural metaphor \u2013 A Room of One\u2019s Own \u2013 as the title of her feminist essay arguing for women\u2019s intellectual agency. The \u2018room\u2019 in question can be interpreted both literally and metaphorically. In literal terms, Woolf writes that \u2018a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.\u2019 Private spaces for writing or study would have been luxuries for many women in the early 20th century. But the title\u2019s full import is best understood as a metaphor that expresses the right of women to uninterrupted and self-driven intellectual pursuits \u2013 an idea Woolf explores throughout her essay. Today, feminists use the architectural metaphor of the \u2018glass ceiling\u2019 to express the barriers often invisible to men (hence \u2018glass\u2019) that women experience as they climb the corporate ladder. Similarly, members of the LGBTQ+ community are encouraged to \u2018come out of the closet\u2019 to become socially visible. More recently, at the 2020 George Floyd protests, the call-and-response cry \u2018Whose streets? Our streets!\u2019 was used to communicate the unmet right of racial minorities to feel safe in public spaces. Like Woolf\u2019s title, these expressions can be interpreted literally, but their full effect is best understood metaphorically. As spatial metaphors, they help describe how minority groups experience and seek to overcome social barriers. Without these metaphors, it can be very difficult to express, for example, the feelings of social isolation and constraint that members of the LGBTQ+ community experience from hiding their gender identity or sexual orientation. Through spatial metaphor, non-group members can understand the feelings of social isolation and constraint of a life lived \u2018in the closet\u2019. Even the Left-Right political spectrum, which seems to lead toward political extremism, can be reconstructed using novel spatial metaphors. Spatial metaphors like \u2018partisan\u2019, \u2018polarised\u2019 or \u2018extremist\u2019 are often used to describe individuals who hold the strongest political views. These spatial metaphors generate meaning by referencing positions along a horizontal line with poles extending in opposite directions. But what if, rather than a straight line, we positioned political opinions on a horseshoe? First coined in 2002 by the French philosopher Jean-Pierre Faye, \u2018horseshoe theory\u2019 has been debated by political theorists since the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, a treaty of non-aggression signed in 1939 between Hitler\u2019s Nazi government and Stalin\u2019s Communist Party. Since then, the theory has been used to explain, among other things, the fact that 12 per cent of people who voted for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primaries voted for Donald Trump in the presidential election, arguably costing the \u2018Left-leaning\u2019 candidate, Hillary Clinton, the election. Another example is that politicians and pundits on both the far-Left and far-Right have advocated anti-interventionist positions regarding the war in Ukraine. But that\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t massive ideological differences between far-Left and far-Right political positions. Like the simple binary of the Left-Right spectrum, political theorists have argued that horseshoe theory also overly simplifies the ideological landscape. What is clear, though, is that novel spatial metaphors offer alternative forms to what are otherwise restrictively linear forms of political thought. T he possibilities of rethinking the shapes of social thought may seem vast. But spatial metaphors don\u2019t always liberate. As is the case with a rigid conceptualisation of the Left-Right spectrum, sometimes they place constraints on social thought. The titles given to authority figures in our social and political institutions, such as \u2018Headmaster\u2019, \u2018Your Highness\u2019 or \u2018Supreme Court\u2019, often reference spatial conditions of height and mass. Even the title \u2018President\u2019 can be decomposed to a spatial metaphor: from the Latin praesident (\u2018sitting before\u2019). \u2018Highness\u2019; The Coronation of Emperor Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna (1898) by Laurits Tuxen. Hermitage Museum/Wikipedia For this reason, it\u2019s important to tune our ears to the spatial and architectural metaphors that may be constraining our interpersonal relations and political discourse. These metaphors can indicate growing mental divisions between social groups. Consider Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and his rhetoric about building a wall along the southern US border. While some new border fencing was built during Trump\u2019s presidency, the former president\u2019s proposal to build an impenetrable wall is best understood as a metaphor that signalled a wider shift toward an isolationist stance in foreign policy and immigration. Metaphorical barriers remain standing long after their physical referents are demolished Similarly, for many people, the Great Wall of China marks a clear distinction between the Chinese nation to the south and marauding barbarians to the north. This idea endures, even if this literal wall has always been, in fact, a collection of many lesser walls \u2013 a porous physical reality that belies the monumentality of the metaphor. In Germany, citizens continue to overestimate distances between cities that were on the other side of what was the Iron Curtain, in comparison with cities on the same side before reunification. Further, these overestimations are greater for citizens with more negative attitudes toward reunification, compared with those of citizens who had positive views. Metaphorical barriers remain standing long after their physical referents are demolished. For millennia, architects have designed buildings with spatial forms that far exceeded the functional needs of their occupants. Instead, they often sought to create structures that would be understood as metaphors for social power. Similarly, writers, activists and politicians have relied on spatial and architectural metaphors to communicate their social experiences and desires. Recent cognitive neuroscience research shows that there is a neurobiological basis for both effects. This mechanism provides insight into the phenomenology, the subjectivity, of social experience, but it should also lead us to carefully consider what our movements and positions in space say about our social agency and status. Equally, it could lead to an understanding of how the architecture built for people in cities reflects the spatial distances implicitly attributed to them. Insight isn\u2019t all. There are also radical possibilities in social-spatial thought. Through this mechanism we can become architects of our collective experiences, building new metaphors for social life and shaping the geometries of other people in our minds.

Today scientists are exploring the boundaries between Self and Others and unsurprisingly, they are finding the all wondrous ways in which we are not separate. This interconnectedness was explored recently in an episode of NPR\u2019s Invisibilia. The show looked at the many ways in which our lives \u2014 and our very being \u2014 are entangled, like two atoms separated by a large distance, but still intimately affected by the other. One way in which we are connected with others is the way we act and feel. Many people walk around thinking that their actions and emotions arise entirely from within \u2014 from somewhere in the brain, caused by a series of physiological events. But the truth is we are like giant radio receivers, picking up the signals put out by others and imitating them. You may have already noticed that if you spend any amount of time around other people, you might adjust your posture or speech patterns to mimic theirs. Sometimes it\u2019s something less obvious, like how quickly you blink or breathe. Over time, you may start to match your actions with theirs and all without conscious control. \u201cWhether you want to or not, all day long, you are engaged in a kind of synchronized dance with the people you come into contact with,\u201d said Lulu Miller, co-host of Invisibilia. For some people, this mimicry can be more extreme \u2014 they actually feel what they see other people feeling. If someone else receives a hug, they feel that hug. If they watch people eating, they feel food in their mouth, even though they themselves are not eating. Scientists have studied people like this \u2014 who have a condition called mirror-touch synesthesia \u2014 and found that essentially the wires of their visual system and touch system are crossed. This gives them a deep connection with other people. But these people also have less gray matter in the part of the brain that helps them distinguish self from other. For them, \u201cthere are no others\u201d is a physiological state of their brain. But all of us experience this kind of effect to some degree. And it can even bleed over into other, more subtle aspects of our personality like our emotions. Some emotions show up on our face as a broad smile or a creased forehead. But our faces also leak out much smaller, micro-expressions that signal things like happiness, anxiety and depression. When we pick up on the micro-expressions of other people, we unconsciously imitate their facial expressions. From that, we start to develop the same emotions \u2014 building them from the outside in. \u201cWe get real pale, little reflections of what others are thinking and feeling,\u201d said Elaine Hafield, a psychological researcher from the University of Hawaii, on the show. This is the ripple effect caused by our emotions, passing from one person to the next like a contagion. Until we are all connected \u2014 was never really a question in the first place. Or as Miller explains: \u201cIt\u2019s like without quite being aware of it, we are all one organism, a heaving, swirling organism contracting the feelings and thoughts of the people around us.\u201d There was one moment of brilliance, I was told, when a North American missionary visiting in Latin America was asked if clothing and sheets lasted longer in her first-world home. The question was not surprising and it reflected cross-cultural understanding: bedsheets and clothing in the U.S. can last for quite some time, while bedsheets and clothing in the host country wear out quickly, perhaps in a few weeks, and it is nickle-and-dime drain on none-too-deep pockets to keep replacing them. The question, perceptive enough, was a question about privilege and easy living. The missionary's response was astute. She thought for a minute, and then said that yes, sheets in her home area lasted much longer than several weeks if properly cared for... and continued to explain, in addition, what people wore when they were all bundled up for bitter cold. Winter clothing normally goes well beyond what is needed for modesty, and gloves, hats, and scarves (or, today, ninja masks) exist because on the very worst days every square inch of exposed skin will be brutally assaulted. The conversation ended with a slight degree of pity from people who only wore clothes for modesty realized that yes, as they had heard, bedsheets and normal clothing lasted much longer than several weeks, but there were some other price tags to pay. The missionary's communication was in all sympathetic, human, and graceful. Something similar may be said of the degree of IQ where you learn firsthand that being making other people envious is not a good thing, and where it happens more than once that you need to involve authorities or send a C&D letter for harassment to stop, and where others' insecurities leave you socially skating on thin ice surprisingly often. Nonetheless, what may be the most interesting social lesson may have every relevance to \"UX,\" or User eXperience, and it has to do with what is called \"theory of other minds\". The normal conditions for developing \"theory of other minds\" can run into difficulties, but there is something very valuable that can happen. Theory of other minds, Split into \"theory of like minds\", and: \"theory of alien minds\": A Copernican shift One classic developmental step in communication is developing a \"theory of other minds\", meaning that you relate to people as also having minds, rather than as some sort of thing that emits what may be inexplicable behaviors instead of acting out of human motives and beliefs. Part of how the normal \"theory of minds\" develops is that children tend to give adults gifts they would like to receive themselves, such as colorful toys rather than books. At a greater stage of maturity, people can go from giving gifts they would themselves like to receive, to giving gifts they would not want as much themselves, but another person would. However, in normal development this is an advanced lesson. For most people, the baseline is assuming that most people think like them most of the time. For outliers in some dimensions, this simple picture does not work. People start with the same simple assumption: that you can relate to people as basically thinking like you. But if you're different enough, you'll break your shins with this approach. Perhaps outliers communicate markedly better if they know one person who starts on the same page, but communication is harder. The crucial distinction I would draw is between theory of like minds and theory of alien minds. Both theory of like minds and theory of alien minds relate to others as having minds. But theory of like minds is based on the assumption that other people think as you do. Theory of alien minds also really and truly relates to others as having minds, but it is based on a realization that you are not the center of the universe, others often do not think like you, and you need to build bridges. \"Theory of like minds\" says, \"Other people have minds that are basically just like mine.\" \"Theory of alien minds\" takes a step back, saying, \"Other people have minds, and they have minds whether or not they're basically just like mine. This Copernican shift has every relevance to \"Let's not forget the user\" disciplines in UX. So what does a \"theory of alien minds\" really look like? Let me provide several examples, before getting into what it has to do with UX: Hayward has worked long and hard to communicate well. Many people might guess that the features of his [giftedness] would bring benefits... ...but few guess how much. The same kind of thing goes with excellent communication. When a friend came from out of town to live in a local apartment, quite a few friends gathered to help unload the moving van. Hayward, asked for an assignment, expecting to be asked to carry something. Instead, for reasons that are still not clear, she handed him a leash and asked him to look after a dog she has introduced as not at all comfortable around men. And the dog very quickly moved as far away as his leash would allow. But Hayward worked his magic... and half an hour later, he was petting the dog's head in his lap, and when he stood up, the dog bounded over to meet the other men in the group. In another setting, Hayward was waiting for labwork at a convenient care center, when a mother came in, with a four-year-old daughter in tow. The girl was crying bitterly, with a face showing that she was in more pain than she knew how to cope with, and an ugly bulging purple bloodblister under her thumbnail. Hayward understood very well what was going on; his own experience as a child who smashed a thumbnail badly enough to get a bloodblister underneath, was the most pain he had experienced yet in his life. When the convenient care staff threw the mother a wad of paper to fill out before treatment (as opposed, for instance, to first just administering anaethesia and only after that detain the mother with paperwork), she left the child crying alone in a chair. Hayward walked over, wanting to engage the girl in conversation in the hopes of lessening her pain. He crouched down to be at eye level, and began to slowly, gently, and calmly speak to the child. Some time later, Hayward realized two things. First of all, his attempt to get the girl to talk were a near-total failure. He had started by asking her favorite color, and she was able to answer that question. But essentially every other age-appropriate prompt was met with silence: \"Q: What kind of instrument does a dog play?\"\u2014\"A: A trom-bone.\" (But maybe her pain was too great to allow regular conversation.) Second of all, she had stopped crying. Completely. And her face no longer showed pain. He had, partly by his nonverbal communication, entirely absorbed her attention, and she was unaware of pain that had her bawling her eyes out some minutes before. Hayward realized this with a start, and tried to keep up the conversation such as it was, regardless of whether he had anything to say. A rather startled Hayward did his best not to break the illusion, and did so smoothly enough that she seemed not to notice. Some time later, Hayward was called for his blood draw. He returned to find the mother comforting her daughter, as she had not done before. The little girl was crying again, but it was a comforted crying, a world of difference from when she was alone with really quite vile pain. The mother seemed awestruck, and kept saying, \"You have a very gentle way about you.\" Another time, Hayward was asked to substitute-teach a class for parents of English as a Second Language students. He was provided an interpreter who spoke Spanish and English, and the class met all objectives... And Hayward didn't really use the interpreter. He adapted to language and culture to bring an enjoyable class for everyone. When studying abroad, Hayward was quite pleasantly surprised (and very much surprised) when a Ghanain housemate said Hayward had challenged some assumptions, saying Hayward was \"like a white American, and like a black African, closer than an African brother...\" and from that point on he enjoyed insider status among Ghanian friends. He has perhaps never received a greater compliment. Hayward thinks at a fundamentally different level, and he needs to build bridges. But the good news is that he has been working on bridge-buildling for years and built bridges that span great differences. Being in a situation where has to orient himself and bridge a chasm doesn't really slow him down that much. In addition, these \"super powers\" can have every relevance to business work. No employer particularly cares if he can read ancient and medieval languages: but one employer cared that he could easily read bureaucratic documentation that was incomprehensible to everyone else. No employer really cares that at the age of 13 Hayward crafted crafted a four-dimensional maze, worked on visualizing a 4-cube passing through 3-space, and looked at a data visualization in his calculus book and (re)invented iterated integration... But some employers care a great deal that he can take a visualization project, start work along the lines suggested by Tufte's corpus of written work, and start to take steps beyond Tufte. No employer really seems to care that he has studied at the Sorbonne, UIUC, and Cambridge (England) in three very different fields: but co-workers have been puzzled enough that he so effortlessly shifts his communication and cultural behavior to have a colleague and immigrant ask him why he relates to Little Russia's culture so well. But some employers appreciate his efforts to listen and understand corporate culture. In serving like a consultant for a travel subsidiary, Hayward's contacts within the organization that picked up he was trying to understand their language on their terms, and the Director of Sales and Marketing half-jokingly asked, \"Do you want to be a travel agent?\" Hayward perhaps would not be an obvious fit for personality factors, but she picked up a crystal-clear metamessage: \"I want to understand what you are saying, and I want to understand it on your terms.\" Furthermore, while no employer has yet to care about Hayward's interest in writing, one employer cared a great deal that he took a high-value document concerning disaster recovery and business continuity, valuable enough that it would be significant for the employer to file with e.g. their bank, and took it from being precise but awkward and puzzling to read, to being precise, accessible, simple, and clear. What does this communication across barriers have to do with UX? Everything . I've had postgraduate training in anthropology, cognitive science, computer science, philosophy, and psychology, and I consider \"theory of other minds\" communication to be out-and-out the central skill in UX. Perhaps the most structural of these disciplines is anthropology, and a training in anthropology is a training in understanding across differences. Once anthropologists found difference by crossing the Pacific and finding aboriginal people untainted by modern technology. Now anthropologists find difference by crossing the street. But the theory of alien minds is almost unchanged. Jakob Nielsen has been beating for essentially forever the drum of \"You are not a user\". Perhaps his most persistent beating of his drum is: One of usability's most hard-earned lessons is that 'you are not the user.' If you work on a development project, you're atypical by definition. Design to optimize the experience for outsiders, not insiders. What this means, in competency, is \"Communicate out of a theory of alien minds.\" Or, if you prefer, a theory of \"outsiders\", but don't assume that deep down inside \"outsiders\" are really just like \"insiders.\" Exercise a theory of alien minds. What Nielsen is telling people not to do is coast on a \"theory of like minds,\" and assume that if a user interface is intuitive and makes sense to the people who built it, it will just as much make sense to the audience it was built for. It won't. You have to think a bit differently to build technology, and that means you need a theory of alien minds. Assuming that you are the center of the universe, even if it's unintentional, is a recipe for failed UX. We all want better than that. Read more of Profoundly Gifted Survival Guide on Amazon! THE NEUROLOGY OF SELF-AWARENESS What is the self? How does the activity of neurons give rise to the sense of being a conscious human being? Even this most ancient of philosophical problems, I believe, will yield to the methods of empirical science. It now seems increasingly likely that the self is not a holistic property of the entire brain; it arises from the activity of specific sets of interlinked brain circuits. But we need to know which circuits are critically involved and what their functions might be. It is the \"turning inward\" aspect of the self\u2014its recursiveness\u2014that gives it its peculiar paradoxical quality. It has been suggested by Horace Barlow, Nick Humphrey, David Premack and Marvin Minsky (among others) that consciousness may have evolved primarily in a social context. Minsky speaks of a second parallel mechanism that has evolved in humans to create representations of earlier representations and Humphrey has argued that our ability to introspect may have evolved specifically to construct meaningful models of other peoples minds in order to predict their behavior. \"I feel jealous in order to understand what jealousy feels like in someone else\"\u2014a short cut to predicting that person's behavior. Here, I develop these arguments further. If I succeed in seeing any further, it is by \"standing on the shoulders of these giants.\" Specifically, I suggest that \"other awareness\" may have evolved first and then counterintutively, as often happens in evolution, the same ability was exploited to model one's own mind\u2014what one calls self-awareness. I will also suggest that a specific system of neurons called mirror neurons are involved in this ability. Finally I discuss some clinical examples to illustrate these ideas and make some testable predictions. There are many aspects of self. It has a sense of unity despite the multitude of sense impressions and beliefs. In addition it has a sense of continuity in time, of being in control of its actions (\"free will\"), of being anchored in a body, a sense of its worth, dignity and mortality (or immortality). Each of these aspects of self may be mediated by different centers in different parts of the brain and its only for convenience that we lump them together in a single word. As noted earlier, there is one aspect of self that seems stranger than all the others\u2014the fact that it is aware of itself. I would like to suggest that groups of neurons called mirror neurons are critically involved in this ability. The discovery of mirror neurons was made by G. Rizzolati, V Gallase and I Iaccoboni while recording from the brains of monkeys performed certain goal-directed voluntary actions. For instance, when the monkey reached for a peanut a certain neuron in its pre-motor cortex (in the frontal lobes) would fire. Another neuron would fire when the monkey pushed a button, a third neuron when he pulled a lever. The existence of such Command neurons that control voluntary movements has been known for decades. Amazingly, a subset of these neurons had an additional peculiar property. The neuron fired not only (say) when the monkey reached for a peanut but also when it watched another monkey reach for a peanut! These were dubbed \"mirror neurons\" or \"monkey-see-monkey-do\" neurons. This was an extraordinary observation because it implies that the neuron (or more accurately, the network which it is part of) was not only generating a highly specific command (\"reach for the nut\") but was capable of adopting another monkey's point of view. It was doing a sort of internal virtual reality simulation of the other monkeys action in order to figure out what he was \"up to.\" It was, in short, a \"mind-reading\" neuron. Neurons in the anterior cingulate will respond to the patient being poked with a needle; they are often referred to as sensory pain neurons. Remarkably, researchers at the University of Toronto have found that some of them will fire equally strongly when the patient watches someone else is poked. I call these \"empathy neurons\" or \"Dalai Lama neurons,\" for they are dissolving the barrier between self and others. Notice that in saying this one isn't being metaphorical; the neuron in question simply doesn't know the difference between it and others. Primates (including humans) are highly social creatures and knowing what someone is \"up to\"\u2014creating an internal simulation of his/her mind\u2014is crucial for survival, earning us the title \"the Machiavellian primate.\" In an essay for Edge (2001) entitled \"Mirror Neurons and the Great Leap Forward,\" I suggested that in addition to providing a neural substrate for figuring out another person's intentions (as noted by Rizzolati's group), the emergence and subsequent sophistication of mirror neurons in hominids may have played a crucial role in many quintessentially human abilities such as empathy, learning through imitation (rather than trial and error), and the rapid transmission of what we call \"culture.\" (And the \"great leap forward\"\u2014the rapid Lamarckian transmission of \"accidental\") one-of-a kind inventions. I turn now to the main concern of this essay\u2014the nature of self. When you think of your own self, what comes into mind? You have sense of \"introspecting\" on your own thoughts and feelings and of \" watching\" yourself going about your business\u2014as if you were looking at yourself from another person's vantage point. How does this happen? Evolution often takes advantage of pre-existing structures to evolve completely novel abilities. I suggest that once the ability to engage in cross modal abstraction emerged\u2014e.g., between visual \"vertical\" on the retina and photoreceptive \"vertical\" signaled by muscles (for grasping trees) it set the stage for the emergence of mirror neurons in hominids. Mirror neurons are also abundant in the inferior parietal lobule\u2014a structure that underwent an accelerated expansion in the great apes and, later, in humans. As the brain evolved further, the lobule split into two gyri\u2014the supramarginal gyrus that allowed you to \"reflect\" on your own anticipated actions and the angular gyrus that allowed you to \"reflect\" on your body (on the right) and perhaps on other more social and linguistic aspects of your self (left hemisphere). I have argued elsewhere that mirror neurons are fundamentally performing a kind of abstraction across activity in visual maps and motor maps. This in turn may have paved the way for more conceptual types of abstraction; such as metaphor (\"get a grip on yourself\"). How does all this lead to self-awareness? I suggest that self-awareness is simply using mirror neurons for \"looking at myself as if someone else is look at me\" (the word \"me\" encompassing some of my brain processes, as well). The mirror neuron mechanism\u2014the same algorithm\u2014that originally evolved to help you adopt another's point of view was turned inward to look at your own self. This, in essence, is the basis of things like \"introspection.\" It may not be coincidental that we use phrases like \"self-conscious\" when you really mean that you are conscious of others being conscious of you. Or say, \"I am reflecting\" when you mean you are aware of yourself thinking. In other words, the ability to turn inward to introspect or reflect may be a sort of metaphorical extension of the mirror neurons ability to read others' minds. It is often tacitly assumed that the uniquely human ability to construct a \"theory of other minds\" or \"TOM\" (seeing the world from the others' point of view; \"mind reading,\" figuring out what someone is up to, etc.) must come after an already pre-existing sense of self. I am arguing that the exact opposite is true; the TOM evolved first in response to social needs and then later, as an unexpected bonus, came the ability to introspect on your own thoughts and intentions. I claim no great originality for these ideas; they are part of the current zeitgeist. Any novelty derives from the manner in which I shall marshall the evidence from physiology and from our own work in neurology. Note that I am not arguing that mirror neurons are sufficient for the emergence of self; only that they must have played a pivotal role. (Otherwise monkeys would have self-awareness and they don't). They may have to reach a certain critical level of sophistication that allowed them to build on earlier functions (TOM) and become linked to certain other brain circuits, especially the Wernickes (\"language comprehension\") area and parts of the frontal lobes. Does the mirror neuron theory of self make other predictions? Given our discovery that autistic children have deficient mirror neurons and correspondingly deficient TOM, we would predict that they would have a deficient sense of self (TMM) and difficulty with introspection. The same might be true for other neurological disorders; damage to the inferior parietal lobule/TPO junction (which are known to contain mirror neurons) and parts of the frontal lobes should also lead to a deficiency of certain aspects self-awareness. (Incidentally, Gallup's mirror test\u2014removing a paint splotch from your face while looking at a mirror\u2014is not an adequate test of self-awareness, even though it is touted as such. We have seen patients who vehemently claim that their reflection in the mirror is \"someone else\" yet they pass the Gallup test!) It has recently been shown that if a conscious awake human patient has his parietal lobe stimulated during neurosurgery, he will sometimes have an \"out of body\" experience\u2014as if he was a detached entity watching his own body from up near the ceiling. I suggest that this arises because of a dysfunction in the mirror neuron system in the parieto-occipital junction caused by the stimulating electrode. These neurons are ordinarily activated when we temporarily \"adopt\" another's view of our body and mind (as outlined earlier in this essay). But we are always aware we are doing this partly because of other signals (both sensory and reafference/command signals) telling you you are not literally moving out of yourself. (There may also be frontal inhibitory mechanisms that stop you from involuntarily mimicking another person looking at you). If these mirror neuron-related mechanisms are deranged by the stimulating electrode the net result would be an out-of-body experience. Some years ago we examined a patient with a syndrome called anosognosia who had a lesion in his right parietal lobe and vehemently denied the paralysis. Remarkably the patient also denied the paralysis of another patient sitting in an adjacent wheelchair! (Who failed to move the arm on command from the physician.) Here again was evidence that two seemingly contradictory aspects of self\u2014its individuation and intense privacy vs. its social reciprocity\u2014may complement each other and arise from the same neural mechanism, mirror neurons. Like the two sides of a Mobius strip, they are really the same, even they appear\u2014on local inspection\u2014to be fundamentally different. Have we solved the problem of self? Obviously not\u2014we have barely scratched the surface. But hopefully we have paved the way for future models and empirical studies on the nature of self, a problem that philosophers have made essentially no headway in solving. (And not for want of effort\u2014they have been at it for three thousand years). Hence our grounds for optimism about the future of brain research\u2014especially for solving what is arguably Science's greatest riddle. Margarita* started a recent session with a litany of complaints about her husband. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t do anything around the house,\u201d she said. \u201cHe expects me to work a full day at my job and then come home, make dinner, deal with the kids, and have sex with him. I know he works all day, and that he\u2019s tired when he gets home. But really, what does he think I do all day? Lie on the couch and watch tv? I\u2019m at work too.\u201d Richard* was deeply upset by the fact that his adolescent daughter was always mad at him. \u201cWe used to be so close,\u201d he told me. \u201cNow she\u2019s always acting like I\u2019m stupid. She doesn\u2019t like anything about me\u2014how I dress, how I talk, how I eat. I\u2019m sad, but I\u2019m angry, too. I don\u2019t know what to do. I feel like just staying as far away from her as I can get. But I\u2019m worried that she\u2019s going to get into some kind of trouble, so I also feel like I have to keep an eye on her.\u201d Although there were several reasons for these difficulties, Margarita and Richard were both describing a theme that surfaces repeatedly in my work with individual clients and couples: we humans desperately want to be recognized as a whole, complex person with our own feelings, thoughts, and needs. From the very beginning of our lives, we need another person to reflect back to us that they see us in all of our complexity and that they care about us, even with our flaws and limitations. Developmental research has shown that children learn to know who they are from the responses of the people who care for and about them. We are apparently wired to need others to mirror us and validate our feelings and thoughts. Too often, however, we feel that people who are important to us\u2014children, parents, colleagues and supervisors at work, intimate partners, and friends\u2014only see part of us. When they focus on something negative, we start to feel inadequate or like a failure. If someone whose opinion is important to us sees us as bad, we end up feeling like we are bad, and frequently we spend an inordinate amount of time trying to prove to them\u2014and ourselves\u2014that we are good. Richard, for example, needed his daughter to let him know that he was a good dad. But she was at a stage of life when she needed him to let her be angry with him and still see her as a good daughter. Neither of them liked the self that was reflected back by the other person, which hurt their feelings and made them angry. When someone we care about sees us as nothing but an extension of themselves, whose job is to serve their needs, we may spend much of our time trying to please them. At the same time, we also often try, sometimes unsuccessfully, to prove to them that we have needs and feelings of our own. This is part of what was going on with Margarita and her husband. The thing about this need for acceptance of our whole selves, good and bad, is that it\u2019s a two-way street. At the very same time that someone is doing this for us, we are often also doing it for them. Psychoanalysts D.W. Winnicott and Heinz Kohut called this interaction \u201cmirroring,\u201d by which they meant that we learn to know ourselves based on the reflection of ourselves in the face, actions, and reactions of the people around us. Attachment theorists and researchers found that mutual mirroring goes on between parents and infants from the very beginning of a baby's life. Why Relationships Matter Find a therapist to strengthen relationships When a couple comes for therapy, the first thing they want to talk about is the negative or critical feelings they have for each other. While I listen and try to understand what they are unhappy about, I also look and listen to see if they are at all able to acknowledge one another\u2019s positive qualities. Being able to comment on things they appreciate about one another even when they're angry at each other is often a good sign for the relationship. When I\u2019m working with someone individually, I want to know what ways they get mirrored by others, and what ways they reflect what they think about these same people. Often, just starting to think about how you are mirroring another person can start to change how they mirror you. That\u2019s what happened with Richard and his daughter. After one particularly obvious eye-roll, Richard said, \u201cHey, sweetie, I get it that you\u2019re pissed at me for a lot of different reasons. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m so frustrating. But I want you to know two things. First, most important, I think you're an amazing person, and I love you even when you\u2019re angry and frustrated with me. But second, I want you also to know that I have feelings. And sometimes, even though you are upset with me, I would appreciate it if you\u2019d just let me know that you love me too.\u201d Relationships Essential Reads His daughter burst into tears and threw her arms around him. \u201cI do love you, Dad,\u201d she said. And then she laughed. \u201cEven though you embarrass me all the time.\u201d Not everyone responds quite so quickly or so well. When Margarita told her husband that she saw that he was frustrated with her, he just nodded and kept playing with their children. But she hung in there, trying to find ways to communicate that she noticed how tired he was, or that he needed her to respond to him in certain ways. Her husband was much more of a doer than a talker, so she was pleased when he quietly started setting the table before dinner. A little at a time, she began to feel seen by him. \u201cEven sex has changed,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot more attentive to my body than ever before. He still doesn\u2019t talk about anything. But I feel like he sees me as a whole person, not just his servant.\u201d Recognizing that mutual reflection is part of every relationship can lead to significant change in your feelings about yourself and about another person. *Names and identifying information changed to protect privacy. Copyright @fdbarth2023. Facebook/LinkedIn image: Alejandro J. Vivas/Shutterstock Imagine that when you die your life is converted into an extremely long, first-person YouTube video, which you may review at your leisure. While you\u2019re fast-forwarding through it, looking for certain memorable moments, one thing you\u2019d see frequently is a person you know entering the room you\u2019re in, talking with you for a while, and then leaving for a much longer while. Seeing people come and go like this might crystalize one of the poignant realities of living a human life: you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s there from start to finish. In life, there\u2019s you \u2014 the omnipresent Protagonist \u2014 and then countless Other People. Most of them are bit players, but some of these Other People are major characters in your story. They might spend quite a lot of time onscreen, but they always remain Other People. You never get to see inside their heads, you don\u2019t get to choose their behavior, and ultimately you know them only by what they do and what they say. Most of the time, no matter how large their role in your story, they\u2019re simply offscreen \u2014 somewhere out there in the world, doing who knows what. I had a surreal moment, while having dinner with one of my favorite Other People, in which I realized that at that moment, as I sat across a Formica table in a local pizza place, that I was the Other Person. At least for my friend, I was the person who was not present most of the day, who at some point appeared at the door, smiled and sat down at the far side of the table, talked about what I\u2019d been up to, ate some pizza, walked with her to the corner, said goodbye, and disappeared again into the distance. I am one of many Other People for her, just as she is for me. As I was walking home it occurred to me that I was again completely off-screen in her story, and that I am always one of these mostly-off-screen Other People, for everyone except myself. I am a first-person protagonist in the small and specialized corner of reality that is my own life. In everyone else\u2019s life, I\u2019m an autonomous \u2014 and to some degree mysterious \u2014 visiting character. This is true for you too of course. Your primary role in the world, by far, is that of an Other Person. There\u2019s only one person to whom you are the first-person Protagonist \u2014 to everyone else you are always the other person in the elevator, the diner booth, the bed, the car, the parking garage. There\u2019s a distinct difference between acknowledging this basic idea that you are someone else to other people, and really seeing yourself as the Other Person you constantly are \u2013 someone who\u2019s sometimes physically present with a given Protagonist but usually not, whose inner world is invisible and only theoretical, who\u2019s out of sight and out of mind most of the time, but might appear at the doorway, or in a car coming up the road, or as a notifying ding coming from a phone on a nightstand. All Other People are exactly this sort of \u201cvisitor from outside,\u201d and all of us are Other People. Recognizing our status as a full-time Other Person could certainly help us be more humble and more aware of our effect on others, on the energy we bring into a room (or suck from it). We all know how deflating it is when an Other Person is being difficult, self-absorbed, overly negative, or uninterested. We also know how welcome it is when the person you\u2019re dealing with is easygoing, interested, and pleasant. Simply by remembering that your role to everyone else is that of Mostly-Not-There Other Person (and that everyone else is also a Protagonist) it\u2019s easy to be a better Other Person, whether this time it\u2019s as a random co-worker assigned to the same project, a customer coming up to the counter, or a boyfriend going to a movie selected by his partner. It\u2019s easy to be a better Other Person because being an Other Person happens in short segments, so it\u2019s usually a small task. You can easily be more patient, just for this interaction. You can consciously tone down your frantic energy when you ask someone for help. You can be less intent on getting your coffee made as quickly as you expect, and more intent on being a pleasant customer. When you\u2019re dealing with someone close to you, you can remember the qualities they love to see in you, and embody a bit of that for them right now. These efforts are applied over short periods of time, often only a single moment, and they really matter to people. They change what kind of Other Person you are. Yes, it\u2019s easy to be a better Other Person, and it\u2019s hard to be a better Protagonist, even though we\u2019re usually preoccupied with our role as a Protagonist and our Protagonist problems. Being a better protagonist, the implicit goal of self-help, is an endless, ill-defined personal quest that nobody else quite understands or can help much with. Viewing life through the lens of Protagonist, you\u2019re essentially faced with the whole existential mess of being human \u2013 ageless questions nobody has satisfactory answers for. How do I become a good enough person? How do I master my time and effort? How do I keep my loved ones safe in a dangerous world? What do I pursue and what do I sacrifice? How do I make my life a good one? While we\u2019re focusing on being the best possible Protagonist in our respective inner stories, everyone else is seeing only how we\u2019re doing in our other, more public role. If you think about what people are admired and remembered for, it\u2019s always for the kind of Other Person they were. *** Last call for aspiring meditators!

[Take me to Camp!] Photo by Christina Photo: Caras Ionut Our sense of self \u2013 who we see ourselves to be \u2013 is highly infectious. We cannot keep ourselves to ourselves. When we are under the illusion that we are what we look like \u2013 a person, separate from other people \u2013 our state of mind broadcasts to others and influences them. But when we see through this illusion to the clear No-thing at our centre, this awake emptiness that contains all things, this state of mind also broadcasts \u2013 and influences others. Let me illustrate how this plays out during our lives. There are potentially four main stages in our lives \u2013 the baby, the child, the adult and the seer. 1. The Baby Essentially the baby is open, faceless, at large, space for the world. It is not yet seeing itself from outside, from a few feet away, as it appears to others \u2013 with a face. It is seeing itself only from its own point of view \u2013 a single Eye full of the world. Of course, it doesn\u2019t think in these or any terms. It just is. Looking at your mother, you are room for your mother \u2013 face there to no face here. Watch how this Openness affects those around the baby. An adult is talking with a mother holding her baby. Then he turns to the baby and his face opens \u2013 he even starts speaking in \u2018baby speak\u2019. He looks into the baby\u2019s eyes with no feeling of self-consciousness. The baby\u2019s state of mind \u2013 its facelessness - gives the adult permission to be faceless, open, at large. Then the adult turns back to the mother and puts his face on again\u2026 A baby\u2019s Openness is powerful. Non-verbally the baby is saying: \u201cI am open for you, I am space for you. There is no distance here \u2013 we are exchanging faces. I am in you and you are in me. Enjoy this with me.\u201d Obviously the baby is not actually saying or thinking this \u2013 but this is its state of mind, or rather state of being. It is hard to resist! 2. The Child A child of five years has been learning for five years about its appearance. Everyone around it is telling it (mainly non-verbally): \u201cYou are what you look like to us. You cannot see your face, but you have one. Look in the mirror, put that face on, and act as if you are behind it, inside that body.\u201d We cannot resist this feedback. Our parents, friends, everyone is saying: \u201cI am in this body, and you are in that body. We are separate. Become aware of this and take responsibility for the actions of your body \u2013 for your actions\u2026\u201d Far from resisting this process of identification, we embrace it enthusiastically. As children we want to be a part of this new world, to be someone in this society. This is healthy \u2013 it is an essential aspect of growing up. In fact, growing up is this process of working out which person you are and taking responsibility for being him or her. But as children we still have one foot in the Open World from which we are emerging. Unselfconscious we are still free, at large, making things up as we go along\u2026 most of the time. But as the months go by we are less and less in this headless childhood world and increasingly in the headed adult world\u2026 Say I am a child in the garden, wide-open to the flowers and birdsong, when someone calls my name. Suddenly I feel self-conscious, shrinking from being as wide as the sky to the one in the mirror \u2013 the one in my mind. Or I am racing around being a bird or a plane and dad tells me to behave. Immediately I jump into \u2018myself\u2019, the one with a face. From being at large and free, increasingly I find myself \u2018boxed in\u2019. Childhood is this back and forth between being Nobody, natural and free, and being Somebody\u2026 And as I grow up I spend less and less time being Nobody\u2026 Why do we love being around children? Surely because their contact with their essential Openness and Freedom is contagious. It gives us permission to see the world afresh, as we used to when we were children. With children we can for a moment be free again, we can be spontaneous, we can again live outside our adult boxes\u2026 Gazing unselfconsciously into a child\u2019s eyes, making faces, being a train or a bird, making nonsense sounds for fun\u2026 we are transported to our Childhood whose essence is our self-free Self. The child there gives us permission to find the Child here. \u201cHey adult, stop being an adult and come sail with me across wild seas to a land of wonder and mystery\u2026\u201d At the same time, we as adults cannot help but guide children into their self-boxes. There comes a time when we must all put aside childhood and \u2018grow up\u2019. 3. The Adult As adults we have made the leap into becoming people. I am now profoundly convinced I am what I look like to others. The idea of being space for the world, of being at large, of being face to no face with others \u2013 in this adult stage this sounds like madness, or at best, childish fantasy. In adult society we all agree that we live behind our faces and are therefore face to face with each other. Non-verbally I declare a thousand times a day: \u201cI am here inside this box, you are there inside that box.\u201d This consciousness is everywhere. Who would deny this \u2018reality\u2019? I have only to look at you for you to have the feeling that you are being looked at \u2013 that you are the one that I see\u2026 And you do the same to me: \u201cHey, Richard\u2026\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d I affirm my separate identity without even thinking. Is this what life is all about? Is this the end of the story - you find out who you are in society and then make the best of the cards you\u2019ve been dealt? Is this the purpose of the great adventure of life that started so promisingly \u2013 shrinking from being everything to the one in the mirror? No! This is only Act Three in a four-act play! Now comes the best part\u2026 4. The Seer I look at what I am from my own point of view and take seriously what I find \u2013 faceless, I am not contained in any kind of box here but am at large in the world. I am space for everything\u2026. This is not regressing to being a baby again, for I do not forget what I have learned. I am well-aware that for others I have a face. In other words, I now have two identities: Publicly I am a person, separate from others; privately I am space for the world \u2013 others are in me, face there to no face here. I am the One appearing as an individual. Now I cannot help but broadcast two states of being: I continue acting as if I am a person and therefore continue reflecting back to others how they appear to me. I am still saying, non-verbally: \u201cI am a person and so are you.\u201d But at the same time I am seeing that I vanish in favour of you - I have your face instead of my own. I cannot help but silently declare this reality to everyone I meet. This is not primarily a thought or a feeling - it is a non-verbal looking, listening, sensing. Seeing this, silently I transmit this incredible truth to you: \u201cYou are in me. Your face is mine. I am you.\u201d And therefore I am also saying to you: \u201cYou too are faceless, at large, free! Please enjoy this with me!\u201d When we notice this beautiful, profound, astonishing fact about ourselves: that I am in you and you are in me \u2013 overlooked in Act Three but rediscovered in Act Four \u2013 we don\u2019t need to tell people verbally for them to receive it. We transmit it simply by seeing it. This message, this state of being, is as contagious as the \u201cI am separate\u201d message we are also sending out. Be conscious of your Original Self, your headless Self, which includes your acquired self, your headed self, and carry out an experiment: Can you keep this wonderful reality to yourself? Can you really contain yourself? Why are we so sure that the way we see people, situations and politics is accurate, and the way other people see them is foolishly wrong? The answer, according to new research by UCLA psychology professor Matthew Lieberman, lies in a region of the brain he calls the \"gestalt cortex,\" which helps people make sense of information that is ambiguous or incomplete -- and dismiss alternative interpretations. The research, based on an analysis of more than 400 previous studies, is published in the journal Psychological Review. People often mistake their own understanding of people and events as objective truth, rather than as merely their own interpretation. That phenomenon, called \"naive realism,\" leads people to believe that they should have the final word on the world around them. \"We tend to have irrational confidence in our own experiences of the world, and to see others as misinformed, lazy, unreasonable or biased when they fail to see the world the way we do,\" Lieberman said. \"The evidence from neural data is clear that the gestalt cortex is central to how we construct our version of reality.\" Naive realism may be the single most underappreciated source of conflict and distrust across individuals and groups, he said. \"When others see the world differently than we do, it can serve as an existential threat to our own contact with reality and often leads to anger and suspicion about the others,\" Lieberman said. \"If we know how a person is seeing the world, their subsequent reactions are much more predictable.\" While the question of how people make sense of the world has been an enduring topic in social psychology, the underlying brain mechanisms have never been fully explained, Lieberman said. Mental acts that are coherent, effortless and based on our experiences tend to occur in the gestalt cortex. For example, a person might see someone else smiling and without giving it any apparent thought, perceive that the other person is happy. Because those inferences are immediate and effortless, they typically feel more like \"seeing reality\" -- even though happiness is an internal psychological state -- than they do like \"thinking,\" Lieberman said. \"We believe we have merely witnessed things as they are, which makes it more difficult to appreciate, or even consider, other perspectives,\" he said. \"The mind accentuates its best answer and discards the rival solutions. The mind may initially process the world like a democracy where every alternative interpretation gets a vote, but it quickly ends up like an authoritarian regime where one interpretation rules with an iron fist and dissent is crushed. In selecting one interpretation, the gestalt cortex literally inhibits others.\" Previous research by Lieberman has shown that when people disagree face to face -- for example on a political issue -- activity in their gestalt cortices is less similar than it is for people who agree with one another. (That conclusion was supported by a 2018 study in the journal Nature Communications. UCLA psychologist Carolyn Parkinson and others found that similar neural patterns in the gestalt cortex were strong predictors of who was friends with whom.) Gestalt was a German school of perceptual psychology whose motto was, \"The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.\" The approach focused on how the human mind integrates elements of the world into meaningful groupings. The gestalt cortex is located behind the ear, and it is situated between the parts of the brain responsible for processing vision, sound and touch; those parts are connected by a structure called the temporoparietal junction, which is part of the gestalt cortex. In the new study, Lieberman proposes that the temporoparietal junction is central to conscious experience and that it helps organize and integrate psychological features of situations that people see so they can make sense of them effortlessly. The gestalt cortex isn't the only area of the brain that enables people to quickly process and interpret what they see, he said, but it is an especially important one. Using neurosurgical recordings to understand the \"social brain\" In a separate study, published in April in the journal Nature Communications, Lieberman and colleagues addressed how, given our complex social worlds, we are able to socialize with relative ease. Using the first mass-scale neurosurgical recordings of the \"social brain,\" Lieberman, UCLA psychology graduate student Kevin Tan and colleagues at Stanford University showed that humans have a specialized neural pathway for social thinking. Lieberman, author of the bestselling book \"Social: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Connect,\" said humans are social by nature and have an exceptional capacity for assessing the mental states of others. That ability requires the brain to process a large number of inferences from a vast array of idiosyncratic cues. So why does that process often feel so effortless compared to simple tasks like basic arithmetic? Clear answers have been elusive for those who study social neuroscience. One culprit could be scientists' reliance on functional magnetic resonance imaging, which is effective at scanning where brain activity occurs, but less effective at capturing the timing of that activity. Researchers employed a technique called electrocorticography to record brain activity at millisecond and millimeter scales using thousands of neurosurgical electrodes. They found that a neurocognitive pathway that extends from the back to the front of the brain is especially active in areas closer to the front when people think about the mental states of others. Their findings suggest that the temporoparietal junction may create a fast, effortless understanding of other people's mental states, and that another region, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, may be more involved in thinking things through more slowly and carefully.",
    "gpt_response": "The user query about why we see ourselves in others and even in other things opens up a fascinating exploration into the psychology of perception, empathy, and self-reflection. Based on this query, three new topics to explore could be:\n\n1. The Role of Mirror Neurons in Empathy and Social Understanding: Investigating how mirror neurons contribute to our ability to empathize with others and understand their actions and emotions as if they were our own.\n\n2. The Psychological Mechanisms Behind Projection and Identification: Exploring the psychological processes that lead individuals to project their own traits, desires, or flaws onto others, and how identification with others plays a role in self-discovery and personal growth.\n\n3. The Influence of Social and Cultural Contexts on Self-Perception: Examining how our social environment and cultural background shape the way we see ourselves and others, including the impact of social comparison, cultural norms, and group identity.\n\nBy integrating the original query with these three new topics, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted nature of human perception and interpersonal relationships. This exploration reveals that our ability to see ourselves in others is not only a reflection of our cognitive and emotional processes, such as empathy and projection, but also deeply influenced by our social interactions and cultural contexts. Mirror neurons play a crucial role in facilitating empathy and understanding, allowing us to resonate with others' experiences. Psychological mechanisms like projection and identification help us navigate our internal world and relationships with others, often leading to insights about our own identity and personal growth. Furthermore, the social and cultural environments we inhabit significantly shape our self-perception and how we relate to others, highlighting the importance of considering these contexts in understanding human behavior and relationships."
