# Summary for: Why do humans antropomorphise, explaining from evolutionary psychology

Anthropomorphism, the practice of attributing human characteristics to non-human entities, is a widely observed human behavior. It ranges from naming inanimate objects and pets to investing emotional relationships with them. Despite its common occurrence, anthropomorphism has often been met with skepticism and deemed irrational. However, recent research in evolutionary psychology offers insights into why humans anthropomorphize, suggesting it may not be irrational but rather an adaptive mechanism for dealing with social isolation and maintaining connections.

### Social Connection and Anthropomorphism

Research by Nicholas Epley at the University of Chicago has significantly contributed to understanding the link between anthropomorphism and the human drive for social connection. Epley's studies found that loneliness can increase the likelihood of anthropomorphizing inanimate objects. Lonely individuals are more inclined to attribute human-like characteristics, such as intentions and emotions, to gadgets and pets. This behavior suggests that anthropomorphism might be a response to social disconnection, a way for the brain to fulfill its intrinsic social needs in the absence of human companionship.

### Adaptive Responses to Loneliness

The connection between loneliness and anthropomorphism can be viewed through the lens of evolutionary psychology as an adaptive response to isolation. With social bonds being crucial for survival throughout human evolution, loneliness is not just an unpleasant emotion but a state that can have significant health implications. Research indicates loneliness is associated with a range of health problems, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and reduced mental performance. By fostering a sense of social connection through anthropomorphism, individuals may mitigate some of the adverse effects of loneliness.

### Beyond Just Pets and Gadgets

The tendency to anthropomorphize extends beyond pets and personal gadgets. It also encompasses interactions with technology, such as computers and robots. Experimental studies demonstrate that people can form emotional attachments and even experience therapeutic benefits from interacting with anthropomorphized machines, like the robotic seal Paro, which has been used to improve mental well-being among senior citizens in Japan.

### Societal Implications

The inclination to anthropomorphize, while serving individual emotional and psychological needs, also has broader societal implications. It reflects the human capacity for empathy and underscores the importance of social connections for overall well-being. This behavior can pave the way for utilizing anthropomorphic designs in technology and robotics to enhance social bonds and address loneliness in aging populations.

### Conclusion

The tendency to anthropomorphize, far from being a mere whimsy or irrational behavior, is deeply rooted in the human drive for social connection. Evolutionary psychology provides a framework for understanding anthropomorphism as an adaptive mechanism, particularly in the face of social isolation. By fostering a sense of connection and belonging, anthropomorphism may carry significant psychological and health benefits, emphasizing the intricate links between social relationships and human well-being.
