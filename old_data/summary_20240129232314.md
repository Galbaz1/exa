# Summary for: I am looking for scientific work on antropomorphizing AI and the effect on engagement

The provided text discusses various aspects and research outcomes related to anthropomorphism in AI and interaction with non-anthropomorphic technologies. Key points from each section are as follows:

### Anthropomorphizing AI and Effects on Engagement

- AI technologies, particularly Smart Home Assistants (SHAs), are increasingly being anthropomorphized, attributing human-like characteristics to enhance user engagement.
- Despite the benefits, there's a downside to anthropomorphizing AIs, such as privacy concerns and over-dependence on AI for companionship or advice, which can lead to ethical and psychological issues.

### Introduction to Anthropomorphism in Dialogue Systems

- Automated dialogue systems are often designed to be anthropomorphic to increase user engagement and satisfaction.
- This section explores how dialogue systems' design can influence user perception and the potential for misuse or harm caused by over-reliance on these systems.

### Social Interaction with Non-anthropomorphic Technologies

- The study examines how users interact with non-anthropomorphic smart technologies, such as robot vacuum cleaners and smart appliances.
- Users tend to attribute human-like qualities to these devices, engaging in naming, assigning personalities, and even empathizing with them, highlighting the human tendency to anthropomorphize non-human agents.

### Evaluating Anthropomorphism and Interaction Dynamics

- Research on anthropomorphism in AI often uses the Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma paradigm to evaluate how participants interact with human vs. computer opponents, suggesting that individuals might not distinguish significantly between human and computer opponents in their cooperative behavior.
- Surveys and experiments revealed that social connectedness promotes robot anthropomorphism, and this perceived human-likeness influences user interaction and satisfaction with robots and AIs.

### Linguistic Factors in Anthropomorphism

- Dialogue systems featuring human-like language or voices can significantly influence the degree of anthropomorphism users attribute to them.
- Factors such as voice tone, content of responses, use of pronouns, and the style of communication play a crucial role in how users perceive and interact with AI systems.

### Recommendations and Ethical Considerations

- To minimize risks associated with anthropomorphism in AI, it's recommended that developers carefully design dialogue systems to avoid unnecessary human-like attributes and be transparent about the system's nature.
- Ethical considerations involve ensuring users are aware they are interacting with AI, preventing overestimation of AI capabilities, and avoiding reinforcement of stereotypes or biases.

Each section contributes to the understanding of how anthropomorphism shapes human-AI interaction and the implications for the design, use, and regulation of AI technologies.
