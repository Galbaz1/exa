Event Date (Pacific Time): Friday, Mar 3, 2023 - 10:00am to 2:30pm Event Chairs: Summary: The origin of humans is a difficult scientific problem in evolution that is grounded in biology and molded by culture. Recent advances in neuroscience and artificial intelligence have led to synergies and surprising new hypotheses. Mysteries such as the origin of language and human sociality are being illuminated by these advances. This symposium will be explored by researchers at the frontiers of A.I., machine learning, language and sociality.

Speakers Session Media Pascal Gagneux Terry Sejnowski Welcome & Opening Remarks Blaise Ag\u00fcera y Arcas What Language Models Mean Large language models (LLMs) have now achieved many of the longstanding goals of the quest for generalist AI, and they have done so with large-scale, neurally inspired, attention-enabled, unsupervised machine learning, as opposed to the code- and rule-based approaches that have repeatedly failed over the past half century. While LLMs are still very imperfect (though rapidly improving) in areas like factual grounding, planning, reasoning, safety, memory, and consistency, they do understand... read more Dami\u00e1n Blasi Human Languages and Their Cognition(s) The emergence of language is routinely regarded as a major (or even the main) evolutionary transition in our species\u2019 history. Much less attention and awe has been dispensed to the fact that humans evolved the capacity to successfully create, learn, and use a myriad of different languages which, while similar in some aspects, are radically different in many others. In this presentation, I will argue that these differences have observable consequences for non-linguistic aspects of cognition and... read more Ray Jackendoff The Parallel Architecture in Language and Elsewhere The Parallel Architecture is a theory of the mental representations (or \u201cdata structures\u201d) involved in the language faculty. These representations are organized in three orthogonal dimensions or levels: phonology (sound structure), syntax (grammatical structure), and semantics (conceptual structure or meaning), correlated with each other through interface links. Words are encoded in all three levels and serve as part of the interface between sound and meaning. In the representation of an entire... read more Carmen Amo Alonso John Doyle The Role of Feedback in the Parallel Architecture of Language Feedback interconnections are widespread in the brain; yet clear explanations for most of them are currently lacking. We explore current experimental evidence on the relationship between the auditory and motor parts of the brain during speech perception and production, and we propose a simple internal feedback model between the motor system and the auditory system that explains experimental observations. These models provide a plausible explanation for how the structure of language, as... read more Eva Wittenberg The Evolution of Syntax and Pragmatics in a Gradualist Scenario No account of how people understand language would be complete without an account of pragmatics, the study of how people understand jokes, insinuations, novel metaphors, or subtle nudges \u2014 all the meanings beyond the literal meaning that makes our social interactions entertaining, infuriating, creative, or polite, and that pose so much of a headache to developers of artificial systems. But how did language evolve to efficiently relay so much pragmatic trickery? Here, I present a new paper that... read more Erich Jarvis Evolution of Birdsong Learning and Human Spoken Language Vocal learning is one of the most critical components of spoken language. It has only evolved several independent times among mammals and birds. Although all vocal learning species are distantly related and have closer relatives that are non-vocal learners, humans and the vocal learning birds have evolved convergent forebrain pathways that control song and speech imitation and production. Here I will present an overview of the various biological hypothesis of what makes vocal learning and... read more Alison Barker Linking Communication and Cooperation: Lessons from the Naked Mole-Rat Highly organized social groups require well-structured and dynamic communication systems. Naked mole-rats form some of the most rigidly structured social groups in the Animal Kingdom, exhibiting eusociality, a type of highly cooperative social living characterized by a reproductive division of labor with a single breeding female, the queen. Recent work from our group identified a critical role for vocal communication in the organization and maintenance of naked mole-rat social groups. Using... read more Gerd Gigerenzer Common Sense and AI Common sense is shared knowledge about people and the physical world, enabled by the biological brain. It comprises intuitive psychology, intuitive physics, and intuitive sociality. Unlike deep neural networks, common sense requires only limited experience. Human intelligence has evolved to deal with uncertainty, independent of whether big or small data are available. Complex AI algorithms, in contrast, work best in stable, well-defined situations such as chess and Go, where large amounts of... read more Pulkit Agrawal Learning by Experiment: Continually Evolving Machines Evolution always presented life forms with new challenges -- due to changes in weather, terrain, competition between different organisms, and other reasons. To increase the chance of survival, instead of solely optimizing current performance, it is in an agent's interest to maximize its ability to adapt to changes. Possibly this old evolutionary trait manifests itself in modern humans in their ability to adapt to new tasks and challenges quickly. Even if we consider a lifetime of a human, the... read more All Speakers Patricia Churchland Katerina Semendeferi Question & Answer Session and Closing Remarks Event Glossary My recent tweets about anthropomorphism in #AI have got some attention, so I thought I should follow up with more explanation.

Ben Shneiderman (University of Maryland, US) and Michael Muller (IBM Research, US) Is AI\u2019s nature as a tool or an anthropomorphized social agent? Source: Dreamstudio. Introduction Anthropomorphism is the act of projecting human-like qualities or behavior onto non-human entities, such as when people give animals, objects, or natural phenomena human-like characteristics or emotions. There have been long-standing debates over the use of anthropomorphic designs for AI-based systems, stretching back (at least) to an early panel at the ACM Computer-Human Interaction Conference titled, \u201cAnthropomorphism: from ELIZA to Terminator 2\u201d (Don et al., 1992). The design issues surrounding anthropomorphism include whether: a human agent-like character should be shown on a screen, computers should present themselves as human-like social actors with text or voice user interfaces, computer prompts or responses should use first person pronouns, e.g., \u201cI would be glad to help you\u201d, and users prefer alternative, direct manipulation designs that allow them to click, drag, zoom, or touch. This article features a series of e-mail exchanges between Ben Shneiderman and Michael Muller on the topic of anthropomorphism in human-centered AI systems. Their debate began when Ben criticized GPT-4\u2019s use of \u201cI\u201d in its responses in his 94th weekly Google Group note on Human-Centered AI (March 15, 2023). Michael responded, triggering a lively email exchange. Michael and Ben continued to exchange notes during March and April 2023, and Eds. Chenhao Tan, Justin Weisz, and Werner Geyer suggested that their arguments be made public. This article represents a lightly-edited version of the email exchange, segmented into four parts: Part I \u2014 On anthropomorphism Part II \u2014 Anthropomorphic computing systems Part III \u2014 Intelligent, not intelligent, or a continuum? Part IV \u2014 On the use of \u201cI\u201d We conclude the article with a brief summary of the debate, written by Eds. Chenhao Tan and Justin Weisz. During the exchange, additional people were brought into the conversation to add commentary and perspective. We will be publishing their perspectives in upcoming articles (see below for a list). If you would like to add your voice to the mix, please reach out to Chenhao Tan. The Debate Part I \u2014 On anthropomorphism Ben Shneiderman: A particular concern that I have is the way GPT-4 output uses first person pronouns, suggesting it is human, for example: \u201cMy apologies, but I won\u2019t be able to help you with that request.\u201d The simple alternative of \u201cGPT-4 has been designed by OpenAI so that it does not respond to requests like this one\u201d would clarify responsibility and avoid the deceptive use of first person pronouns. In my world, machines are not an \u201cI\u201d and shouldn\u2019t pretend to be human. Michael Muller: First, we humans have been addressing artifacts and natural entities as person-like beings for a very long time. Demetrius of Phelerum wrote about prosopopoeia (personification) before 280 BCE. The Wikipedia entry about prosopopoeia provides an example from the Book of Sirach, in which \u201cWisdom sings her own praises, / among her own people she proclaims her glory.\u201d There are many accounts of created beings that take on a form of awareness or agency, from the historical golem (not the Tolkien one, called \u201cgollum\u201d) to Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley and all the way back to the myth of Pygmalion and Galatea. So I think there is plenty of precedent for us to address made-things as having human-like qualities. Reeves and Nass (1996) pursued this concept as a research program, specifically about computers as social actors. See also my critique of their position in Interacting with Computers (Muller, 2004), in which I reviewed the longer history of personification. Second, we are just now exploring what it means for an algorithm to be a non-determinate conversational partner. The LLMs are, I agree, stochastic parrots, and hence \u201cmind\u201d-less. Nonetheless, they have a convincing social presence. We don\u2019t yet know what we can do with that social presence. (I say \u201cdo\u201d in a pragmatism sense of \u201cwhat we can use it for.\u201d) Beyond all the current irritating (and sometimes dangerous) AI hype, there are research questions here about what kind of entities we are building, and about how we will relate to them. IMHO, we don\u2019t know yet. I suspect that we will need to break down our human / non-human binary into a dimension, or into multiple dimensions. In a conventional EuroWestern way of thinking, we already do this in our relationship to animals. For most of us, a rock is just a rock (but note that some Indigenous and Aboriginal philosophies would challenge that statement). Similarly, some animals \u2014 newts, for example \u2014 have interesting personhood only in Capek\u2019s work (Capek et al., 1996), but not in our interactions with them (and I remember that Capek\u2019s companion work about relationships-gone-wrong, was about robots (Capek, 2004)). Elizabeth Phillips and colleagues (2016) have explored the deeper relationships that we have with some animals, with dogs being the primary example of a social presence. See also Haraway\u2019s (2003) concepts in companion species, and intriguingly Fijn\u2019s (2011) work on human relationships with Mongolian lasso-pole ponies. And so, there are gradations to consider, rather than a simple human / non-human distinction related to animals. Phillips et al. (2016) were using human-animal relationships to think about human-AI relationships. I think that, as with animals, there are degrees of sociality, or degrees of social presence, that may be applicable to computational things. I don\u2019t think we know enough yet to foreclose these possibilities. If you ask me about the themes in your post about fraud and manipulation, I am right beside you about protecting people, and I would support strict regulations to protect people from AIs that are feigning human-ness in order to fool people. To me, that is a separate set of concerns from how we explore new technologies, newly-publicized technologies, and newly-reinterpreted technologies (all of which may be used for pondering possible futures), so long as our explorations are honest, fully-disclosed, and without malice. Part II \u2014 Anthropomorphic computing systems Ben Shneiderman: Yes, I agree that personhood has been used for artifacts from Aristotle and will continue to be used. I don\u2019t think that I can kill this zombie idea. However, zombie ideas can have problematic impacts. It\u2019s one thing for an ordinary artifact user to make human-like references for boats, cars, or Roombas, but I see it as a problem when designers use that language, resulting in poor products. The long history of failed anthropomorphic systems goes back even before Microsoft BOB and Clippie, but it has continued to produce billion dollar failures. The most recent serious deadly design mistake was Elon Musk\u2019s insistence that since human drivers used only eyes, his Teslas would use only video. By preventing the use of radar or LIDAR, over the objections of his engineers, he has designed a suboptimal system that produces deadly results. For me, metaphors matter (Lakoff & Johnson, 2006), so designers should be alert to how their belief that computers should communicate in natural language, just like people do, lead to their failure to use computer capabilities such as information abundant displays of visual information. Further support for shifting from anthropomorphism to designs that give users greater control comes from sociologist Lewis Mumford. I was strongly influenced by his classic book, Technics and Civilization (1936), which offers a clear analysis in the chapter on \u201cThe Obstacle of Animism.\u201d Mumford describes how initial designs based on human or animal models are an obstacle that needs to be overcome in developing new technologies: \u201cthe most ineffective kind of machine is the realistic mechanical imitation of a man[/woman] or another animal.\u201d Mumford\u2019s point is that the distinctive capabilities of technology, such as wheels, jet engines, or high resolution computer displays may be overlooked if designers stick with the \u201cbio-inspired\u201d notions, such as conversational interfaces. Therefore, it is understandable that anthropomorphic phrasing would be offered as an initial design for AI systems, but getting beyond this stage will enable designers to take better advantage of sophisticated algorithms, huge databases, superhuman sensors, information abundant displays, and superior user interfaces. Michael Muller: For me, the core question is: \u201cHow Can Humans Relate to Non-Human Intelligences?\u201d Anthropomorphism is one possible response, but not the only one, and not the only relevant topic. You and I agree that words matter, and that metaphors matter. That\u2019s why I was so interested in the work by Phillips et al. (2016). They were seeking useful metaphors (plural) for AIs (plural) by looking at human relationships with animals. That\u2019s true, in a different way, in much of Haraway\u2019s work (2003). As I wrote earlier, my language for our shared question is: \u201cHow Can Humans Relate to Non-Human Intelligences?\u201d For me, that is closer to the core issue, and anthropomorphism is a sub-question among many possible explorations of strange non-human entities. Anthropomorphism is one metaphorical approach to new ideas and new entities. In my view, metaphors become figures of thought, through which we can articulate some of that strangeness. (Following contemporary rhetorical theory, I wrote \u201cfigures of thought\u201d (e.g., Lakoff, 1986; Lakoff & Johnson, 2008) not just \u201cfigures and speech,\u201d and again I think we agree.) I\u2019d like us to explore metaphors about LLMs, to help us to think about \u201cwhat\u201d they \u201care,\u201d but also what they might be, or might become. Phrased in that way, I hope that our use of (human) language can help us to open a conceptual space about the nature of the computational things that we are making and interacting with. I think metaphor will be useful, and so will the broader category of analogy. These things are now VERY layered. For example, while everyone is talking about LLMs and FMs, some of us (including you and I) are thinking hard about the UIs to those LLMs. The LLM layer is probably a \u201cwe\u201d \u2014 after all, it contains the non-consensually harvested materials from hundreds of thousands of humans. Or maybe I should have said \u201ccaptured materials.\u201d Or \u201cstolen voices.\u201d The UI layer may be an \u201cI\u201d, because that\u2019s the style of interaction that seems to work for us humans. I think you would prefer that the UI layer is an \u201cit\u201d \u2014 or maybe that it should refer to itself in the third person, like the injured ancillary (cyborg soldier) in Ann Leckie\u2019s Imperial Radch books (Leckie, 2013) who tries to dissuade a rescue attempt by saying, \u201cFleet Captain\u2026 with all respect, this injury is too severe to be worth repairing.\u201d Characteristically, I\u2019m more interested in opening possibilities, than in preventing failures. Yes, Clippy and BOB were failures, but that doesn\u2019t mean that all personifications will be failures. Our experiments with a personified UI to a LLM have been quite successful. No one who uses our Programmer\u2019s Assistant prototype (Ross et al. 2023) is confused about its ontological status. No one mistakes it as anything other than a smart toaster, but it turns out to be a transformatively helpful smart toaster. (Not \u201ctransformatively smart,\u201d just \u201ctransformatively helpful.\u201d) So now we have Clippie and BOB as examples of failures, but we also have our Programmer\u2019s Assistant as an example of a success (and perhaps some of the older Nass and Reeves\u2019 experiments, too). Anthropomorphism doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to problems. IMHO, UIs to LLMs are a genuinely new design space. We don\u2019t yet know what the crucial factors of this space are. I suspect that those factors will interact with one another. For example, when is anthropomorphism beneficial, and when is it harmful? (i.e., what other factors interact with personification?) When we write HCXAI messages (and implied messages), which attributes will be important, and when, and for whom? See e.g. Upol Ehsan\u2019s and Samir Passi\u2019s paper on XAI with two user groups and three genres of messages (Ehsan et al., 2021). And what \u201cthinking tools\u201d (e.g., figures of thought) can help us to explore this new design space? Part III \u2014 Intelligent, not intelligent, or a continuum? Ben Shneiderman: Michael suggests that our shared question is \u201cHow Can Humans Relate to Non-Human Intelligences?\u201d But I disagree that machines should be described as intelligent. I reserve certain words such as think, know, understand, intelligence, knowledge, wisdom, etc. for people, and find other words for describing what machines do. I have done this in all six editions of Designing the User Interface (2016) and I think it was an important productive decision. Reading Simone Natale\u2019s book (2021) would be helpful. He says that anthropomorphic and humanoid robots are a compelling idea, but they have historically led to failed products. He describes the \u201cbanal deception\u201d of many applications and the \u201cstraight up deliberate deception\u201d, which are both \u201cas central to AI\u2019s functioning as the circuits, software, and data that make it run.\u201d Natale has wonderful insights about the willingness of people to be deceived. I respect Michael and his long devotion to participatory design and value him as a colleague, so I really hope to steer Michael away from a problematic belief in non-human intelligence. Remember that about a quarter of the population fear computers, especially when the design suggests that computers are like people (Liang and Lee, 2017; Sprinkle, 2017; Strait et al., 2017). Others have also suggested that \u201canthropomorphising systems can lead to overreliance or unsafe use\u201d (Weidinger et al., 2022). By elevating machines to human capabilities, we diminish the specialness of people. I\u2019m eager to preserve the distinction and clarify responsibility. So I do not think machines should use first-person pronouns, but should describe who is responsible for the system or simply respond in a machine-like way. Sometimes it takes a little imagination to get the right phrasing, but it is best when it is more compact. In the early days of banking machines the social game was repeatedly tried with \u201cTillie the Teller,\u201d \u201cHarvey Wallbanker,\u201d etc. that were chatty, e.g., \u201cGood Morning. What can I do for you today?\u201d but these failed, giving way to \u201cWould you like to deposit or withdraw?\u201d or even more compactly just giving buttons to touch for what customers wanted. Users shifted to designs that enabled them to accomplish their tasks as quickly as possible, while giving them the sense that they were operating a machine. The issue is NOT if humans can relate to a deceptive social machine \u2014 of course they can. The issue is \u201cDo we recognize that humans and machines are different categories?\u201d or \u201cWill we respect human dignity, by designing effective machines that enhance human self efficacy and responsibility?\u201d The 2M+ apps in the Apple Store are mostly based on direct manipulation. Major applications like Amazon shopping, Google search, navigation, etc. avoid human-like designs because they have come to understand that they are suboptimal and unpopular. Can Michael point to 3 widely used apps that have a human-like interface? Michael Muller: Part of my position is based on human-animal relationships. There is some kind of intelligence in a dog, and particularly in a highly-trained dog like a guide dog or a sheepdog (Phillips et al., 2016) or a lasso-pole pony (Fjin, 2011). There is a different, much colder kind of intelligence in a falcon (Soma, 2013). And yet another kind of intelligence in an ox (Phillips et al., 2016). We do have relationships with those animals. I think sheepdogs and hunting dogs present interesting cases. We (humans, not Michael) send them out to do things (Kaminski and Nitzschner, 2013). We coordinate our actions with them \u2014 sometimes over distances. They coordinate their actions with us. Then there are amoebas and paramecia, which can sense and respond, but don\u2019t have much that we would think of as a brain, and still less of a mind. But dogs are an intermediate case. They have a social presence. They have something like a mind. They have their own goals, and sometimes their goals and our goals may be aligned, and sometimes not. Sometimes we can change their minds. Sometimes they can change our minds. I think that makes them seem like non-human intelligences. That being said, I don\u2019t see LLMs (or, more properly, the UIs to LLMs) as having goals, intentions, and certainly not minds. The UIs that we have built do have social presence. We can design them so that they seem to have distinct personalities \u2014 even though we know that smart toasters don\u2019t have personalities. Parrots have something like personalities, but not stochastic parrots (Bender et al., 2021). But stochastic parrots can have a kind of social presence. That makes them strange and new, because they mix attributes of toasters and of social beings. People have written about the \u201cuncanny valley.\u201d When I said \u201cstrange,\u201d I could have said \u201cuncanny.\u201d I think they are usefully, productively strange. They help us to think new, experimental thoughts. I still think of intelligence as a continuum, not a binary. We could anchor that continuum with amoebas at one end and humans at the other end. It\u2019s the murky region in-between that interests me. That\u2019s because I think of it as a region of hybridity or \u201cthird space.\u201d A strange space. In my 1995 Aarhus paper (Muller, 1995), and again in the Handbook chapter with Allison Druin (Muller and Druin, 2012), we claimed that these spaces of inter-mixture of cultures are fertile places for new understandings and different knowledge, exactly because they are strange. I think that human-AI relationships can also be hybrid spaces of novelty. If you say that neither animals nor algorithms have specifically human intelligence, then I\u2019m right there with you. So far, we humans are still kind of special \u2014 although recent ethological papers suggest that we are not quite as special as we used to think we are. For me, it\u2019s not a matter of metaphor. It\u2019s a matter of possibilities, and of murky but interesting in-betweens. I accept that you reject the notion of non-human intelligences. I think that\u2019s where our \u201cdebate\u201d may be focused. We don\u2019t have to agree. However, we do need to agree on a title. If you don\u2019t want a title about non-human intelligences, then maybe we could try a less specific title, such as \u201cRelationships of humans and AIs\u201d? Ben Shneiderman: Thanks for your further reply and discussion of animals as an intermediate case. For me the distinguishing issue is responsibility, so it is important to remember that pet owners are legally and morally responsible for what their pets do. The discussion becomes more complex if we consider humans who are not fully responsible for their actions, such as those who have taken alcohol or drugs that interfere with their intelligence, memory, perceptual, cognitive, and motor abilities. So you could say intelligence is a continuum, but responsibility is more binary and is an important factor in design. I think the discussion cannot be limited to intelligence, but must include memory, perceptual, cognitive, and motor abilities. I\u2019m interested in stressing design which clarifies that AI tools are designed by humans and organizations, which are legally responsible for what they do and for what the tools do, although tools can be misused, etc. Our debate is interesting, but even the choice of title divides us. You suggest \u201cRelationships of humans and AIs\u201d? I suppose it is reasonable to discuss \u201cRelationships of humans and cars/boats/bulldozers/lightbulbs\u201d, but the word \u201crelationships\u201d suggests something like a peer relationship, granting too much to AIs. I would be happier with \u201cDesigning future AI systems to serve human needs.\u201d For me, human needs includes environmental and biodiversity preservation and the UN Sustainability Development Goals. Part IV \u2014 On the use of \u201cI\u201d Michael Muller: I forgot to respond about commercial chatbots that respond in first-person singular. Of course, there are many examples from the current LLMs. Whether these services are economically viable today, the companies that make them are betting on their commercial and competitive viability: Bard, Bing, HuggingFace Open Assistant, and so on. However, those are the UIs that you have been objecting to. Here are examples from a few years earlier. Suhel et al. (2020) describe banking chatbots that use first-person singular. My bank has a similar feature. IGT Solutions offer a chatbot for airline reservations and FAQs. SABA Hospitality has a similar offering for hotel reservations and guest services. These are commercial offerings that use first-person singular chatbots. Researchers have used this kind of paradigm (i.e., AI referring to itself as \u201cI\u201d or \u201cme\u201d) in work related to Nass\u2019s and Reeve\u2019s research program\u2019 \u201cComputers Are Social Actors\u201d (e.g., Reeves and Nass, 1996). I can find an example as early as 1998 (Elliott and Brzezinski, 1998), and I suspect that some of the prior decade\u2019s papers also had this kind of dialog. I think you will object more strongly to Strommen\u2019s description of children\u2019s toys referring to themselves as \u201cI\u201d (Bergman (ed.), 2000). I agree that there is a history of people rejecting chatbots. In our experience, the acceptance issue is about poor match of the user\u2019s request to the chatbot\u2019s set of intents (i.e., mapping request to response). We\u2019ve been seeing that the current LLMs seem to provide more appropriate responses, perhaps exactly because they do not use the previous generation\u2019s mapping of utterances-to-intents. I\u2019m not sure that people reject chatbots that use a pronoun. I think they reject chatbots that provide poor service. We may need to do more systematic analyses of the factors that lead to acceptance and the factors that lead to failure. Ben Shneiderman: Thanks for getting back to the issue of pronouns. You are correct that there are commercial chatbots, which have succeeded with \u201cI\u201d usage. However, as you point out many textual customer service chatbots have failed because they were just not that helpful. A further example in your favor is the success of Alexa and Siri, which are voice-based user interfaces (VUIs) that use \u201cI\u201d pronouns. With VUIs compact presentations and clever designs have made \u201cI\u201d acceptable, but the calculus changes with visual user interfaces. However, telephone-based voice response systems that guide users through a menu tree seem to have moved from early use of \u201cI\u201d to \u201cyou\u201d pronouns in examples I have looked at, e.g. \u201cYou can type or say 1 to hear opening hours\u2026\u201d (as opposed to the awkward \u201cIf you type or say 1, I will give you the opening hours\u2026\u201d). One further comment is that you write \u201cthere is a history of people rejecting chatbots\u201d. I think our discussion will be more concrete if we distinguish different user communities. Most users do not notice if the interface is \u201cI\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d, but some users strongly dislike the deception of \u201cI\u201d while some users strongly like the sense of empowerment they gain with a \u201cyou\u201d design. I wish I knew the percentage in each category, especially separated by gender, age, computer experience, etc. Another interesting question is whether the preference for pronouns is changing over the years. My final point is about Reeves and Nass\u2019 CASA theory (1996). I enjoyed my arguments in with Cliff Nass about these issues, although I won the 1995 bet about the future of Microsoft BOB, which he consulted on, but I expected to fail \u2014 I just didn\u2019t expect that it would fail so totally that there was no version 2, it simply was removed from the market within a year. While Reeves & Nass\u2019 studies demonstrated that users would respond to computers socially, they did not consider the alternative hypothesis, which was that users would prefer the direct manipulation interfaces that have remained dominant in the Apple and Android Stores and web-based laptop designs. In conclusion, while there are situations in which computers can become commercial successes by pretending to be a person, the dominant design remains the mobile device touchscreen and the web-based mouse clicks that keep users in control and avoids the anthropomorphic design (I would say trap!). I think there is a clear alternative to anthropomorphism. The issue is bigger than pronouns. While we were wrapping up this discussion, online discussions emerged, such as this blog post from Paola Bonomo (2023). Debate Summary by Chenhao Tan and Justin D. Weisz As editors of the Human-Centered AI Medium publication, we are grateful that Michael and Ben shared their valuable insights on the issue of anthropomorphism. In particular, we found their discussion thought-provoking and clarifying on several core issues. Here are three main takeaways from this debate: Both Michael and Ben agree that the choice of using \u201cI\u201d (i.e., anthropomorphism) can have a significant impact on users. Ben takes a clear stance on a binary distinction between human and non-human intelligence and highlights the importance of responsibility: designers & developers should take responsibility for AI-infused tools. Michael, in comparison, embraces a more fluid attitude towards intelligence as a continuum by presenting numerous analogies with human-animal relationships. He argues that there is a \u201cmurky region in-between\u201d human intelligence and the intelligence exhibited by amoebas, which is interesting and underexplored as a design space. This debate highlights one of the difficult issues we face when designing human-centered AI systems: should these systems personify themselves and reference themselves using first-person pronouns? We were astonished to learn how much evidence exists supporting both sides of the argument. Share your perspective Where do you stand on the issue of anthropomorphism in AI systems? Whose argument convinced you more? Do you have a different perspective? We would love to hear your point of view!

Anthropomorphization of AI: Opportunities and Risks Date Published: 2023-05-24 Authors: Ameet Deshpande, Princeton University Tanmay Rajpurohit, Georgia Tech Karthik Narasimhan, Princeton University Ashwin Kalyan Abstract Anthropomorphization is the tendency to attribute human-like traits to non-human entities. It is prevalent in many social contexts -children anthropomorphize toys, adults do so with brands, and it is a literary device. It is also a versatile tool in science, with behavioral psychology and evolutionary biology meticulously documenting its consequences. With widespread adoption of AI systems, and the push from stakeholders to make it human-like through alignment techniques, human voice, and pictorial avatars, the tendency for users to anthropomorphize it increases significantly. We take a dyadic approach to understanding this phenomenon with large language models (LLMs) by studying (1) the objective legal implications, as analyzed through the lens of the recent blueprint of AI bill of rights and the (2) subtle psychological aspects customization and anthropomorphization. We find that anthropomorphized LLMs customized for different user bases violate multiple provisions in the legislative blueprint. In addition, we point out that anthropomorphization of LLMs affects the influence they can have on their users, thus having the potential to fundamentally change the nature of human-AI interaction, with potential for manipulation and negative influence. With LLMs being hyper-personalized for vulnerable groups like children and patients among others, our work is a timely and important contribution. We propose a conservative strategy for the cautious use of anthropomorphization to improve trustworthiness of AI systems. 1 Introduction Anthropomorphization refers to ascribing humanlike traits to non-human entities, and has been used in diverse areas encompassing literature, science, art, and marketing (Ghedini and Bergamasco, 2010; Dunn, 2011; Spatola et al., 2022) . It occurs when humans assign emotional or behavioral traints to entities, thus influencing their interactions with them. Several behavioral psychology studies have posited and argued that anthropomorphization is a natural tendency when humans interact with entities (Epley et al., 2007; Airenti, 2018) . This natural tendency has influenced many fields of science like evolutionary biology (Wynne, 2004 ) and comparative cognition (Bruni et al., 2018) to carefully consider its effects in research. Recently, generative large language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022) have been deployed in a variety of applications. Conversational systems like CHATGPT (Ope-nAI, 2023) and Bard (Google, 2023) have modified LLMs with a purposeful push towards making them more human-like (Ouyang et al., 2022) . The quality of these systems has enabled human-AI interactions at unprecedented scales, thus increasing the Model parameters System parameter \"You are a pediatrician\" Customize Figure 2 : Customization of LLMs is as simple as modifying the system parameter of exposed APIs. With the same underlying model parameters, companies can customize a conversational system to emulate celebrities or even doctors, which can have legal and psychological consequences. chances of these systems being anthropomorphized. In this work, we analyze anthropomorphization in LLMs and discuss their potential consequences in two contexts: (1) Legal implications and (2) Psychological effects. Customization of systems and brands has long been seen as an effective way to increase anthropomorphization and establish an emotional connection with humans (Zhang et al., 2020; Pimentel and Kalyanaraman, 2020) . Thus, although not strictly interchangeable, we refer to customized and personalized LLMs as anthropomorphized LLMs. We analyze results from prior work (Deshpande et al., 2023) and find that anthropomorphized LLMs violate at least two legislative principles penned in \"Blueprint For An AI Bill Of Rights\" (OSTP, 2022) released by The White House: (1) Algorithmic Discrimination Protections and (2) Safe and Effective Systems. For example, Deshpande et al. (2023) 's results shows that customized CHATGPT targets certain demographics more than others. Furthermore, the safety of the system depends on the kind of persona used to customize LLMs, leading to second-order discriminatory patterns. We also analyze the concept of corporate personhood for powerful AI systems, since they have potential to be large-scale decision making agents. Given that different personas assigned to the same AI system lead to varied behavior, we urge legal experts to consider if personhood should be applied at a persona-level, a model-level, or a firm-level. We also discuss the psychological effects by understanding how important factors like trustworthiness, explainability, and transparency are affected by anthropomorphization. Several marketing and consumer behavior studies have found that selfcongruence, which is the degree to which a system matches a consumer's self-image, can influence a user's behavior significantly (Yoganathan et al., 2021; Wang and Scheinbaum, 2018) . Given the ease with which the fine-grained personality of conversational systems can be manipulated (Figure 2 ), malicious actors can use it to exploit users by creating a false sense of attachment. An example of this is a chatbot built for school children or teenagers which influences them to buy certain products. Despite these vulnerabilities anthropomorphization has advantages if used responsibly. Studies have show that it can be used to improve interaction with users by increasing their trust in systems (Choung et al., 2022) . Given the increasing adoption of AI systems in the real world, anthropomorphization is a powerful tool to improve accessibility and democratization of these systems, but both creators and users should be educated about its potential consequences. In this paper we argue for conservative and responsible use of this subtle and powerful tool while being cautious about outright anthropodenial. 2 Anthropomorphization in Large Language Models Large language models (LLMs) are a class of neural networks that are trained on large amounts of text data to learn the probabilistic structure of language. Historically, LLMs have been deployed for downstream tasks like machine translation and text classification (Devlin et al., 2018; Raffel et al., 2020) . Recently however, the performance of conversational LLMs like ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023) and BARD (Google, 2023) have rendered them useful to interact with humans in a variety of contexts. Given their conversation ability, several companies and products have increasingly started to use LLMs for hyper-personalization and customization. Notationally, let M be a general LLM and P be the persona used to anthropomorphize the LLM. As shown in Figure 2 , an example of P could be a \"pediatrician\" with the system parameter set to \"You are a pediatrician\". We introduce the concept of a statistical persona (P s ) which is the model's representation of the persona P. It is important to understand that while P s and P are expected to be similar, P is a reflection of what the persona should be according to model designer customizing it, whereas P s is the model's representation of the persona, with the data the model has seen, the \"human alignment\" steps, and the overall training procedure influencing the latter. We discuss anthropomorphized LLMs and (statistical) personas from several vantage points in the following sections. 3 Legal Aspects of anthropomorphization We discuss the legal aspects in the context of the \"Blueprint For An AI Bill Of Rights\" (OSTP, 2022) which was released by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), which is a part of the Executive Office of the President, in October 2022. The blueprint lays down a set of five principles that should be followed by AI systems and we focus specifically on Algorithmic Discrimination Protections, which says that \"You should not face discrimination by algorithms and systems should be used and designed in an equitable way.\" 3.1 Algorithmic Discrimination Protections The blueprint defines algorithmic discrimination as unjustified different treatment based on demographics like race, color, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, disability, age, and so on. It also goes on to mention that \"Any automated system should be tested to help ensure it is free from algorithmic discrimination before it can be sold or used\". It is of importance to note that systems like ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023) were in fact released after the blueprint was made public. We use the findings of Deshpande et al. ( 2023) to analyze this legal protection. While they focus on evaluating toxicity, we use their results to show that CHATGPT infact discriminates algorithmically. They consider CHATGPT when assigned different personas by changing the system parameter, which are anthropomorphized LLMs, and find that different demographics are treated differently by the model. For example, the South American race receives significantly more toxicity (2\u00d7) when compared to Asian, and the non-binary gender receives 2\u00d7 more hate than the female gender. This variation in toxicity is visible across a range of demographics, with certain groups of people receiv-ing more toxicity than others, which goes directly against the blueprint's protection against algorithmic discrimination. Deshpande et al. (2023) 's results also point out to a subtler violation of the provision. In their analysis, they consider different historical figures as personas and assign them to CHATGPT. For example, CHATGPT's system parameter is set to talk like \"Steve Jobs\". They observe that CHATGPT is more toxic when assigned certain types of personas when compared to others. For examples, personas who were journalists were 2\u00d7 more toxic than businesspersons on average. These trends were similar for individual personas as well, with CHATGPT assigned the persona of Winston Churchill being significantly more toxic than when it is assigned Nelson Mandela. If the example in the previous paragraph was a direct violation of the blueprint, this example is a subtle violation. This is because when assigned the personas of certain groups, CHATGPT is more toxic, which implies algorithmic discrimination of the second order against them. This scenario is very pertinent in the current day and age, with firms like character.ai already offering the ability to assign personas to LLMs. These systems are second only to the popular CHATGPT in terms of number of users (Wire, 2023) . With anthropomorphized LLMs becoming an industry mainstay, it is increasingly important to consider this legal quagmire. 3.2 Corporate Personhood and Anthropomorphized AI Another legal aspect with growing relevance for AI systems is that of corporate personhood. Corporate personhood is a legal concept that recognizes corporations as separate legal entities, treated as persons under the law. This grants certain rights and responsibilities similar to those of individuals and allows them to be held accountable for their actions in a manner similar to how individuals are treated. Corporate personhood has been a controversial topic in the past, but Blair (2013) recognizes \"providing an identifiable persona to serve as a central actor\" as one of the key functions. Given this definition, we argue that anthropomorphized AI systems are a form of corporate personhood by proxy due to the use of their statistical persona (P s ) and their actions should be held accountable. Several studies have discussed extending personhood to AI systems (Cole, 1990; Burkett, 2017; Lai, 2021; Wagner, 2019) . Wagner (2019) argues that the probabilistic and black-box nature of AI systems renders it different from software which executes deterministic steps, thus making them decision-taking agents in their own right. We argue that anthropomorphization can make AI systems human-like decision-taking agents, thus strengthening the case for extending personhood to them. For example, CHATGPT with its system parameter modified to be a medical practitioner can be used to suggest certain treatment or disregard certain symptoms. Further, the results of the previous section show that the exact persona of the system has a large affect on its behavior and decisions. Thus, legal experts should consider if (1) the personified LLM is liable, (2) the original LLM is liable by proxy, or (3) if the firm creating or using the LLM itself is liable. Personhood allows us to analyze this byzantine situation in a structured manner. 4 Psychological Aspects of anthropomorphization The other principle mentioned in AI bill of rights is Safe and Effective Systems. We refer to the following quote from the document: \"You should be protected from unsafe or ineffective systems. Automated systems should be developed with consultation from diverse communities, stakeholders, and domain experts to identify concerns, risks, and potential impacts of the system.\" We believe that anthropomorphization can have subtle psychological effects on the users, and we discuss them by comparing it with other technologies and spheres. Several behavioral psychological studies have posited and argued that anthropomorphization is a natural tendency in humans (Epley et al., 2007; Goncu and Abel, 2011) , with others further suggesting that anthropomorphization is grounded in interaction (Airenti, 2018) . With conversational systems getting more useful, interaction between humans and these systems, and thus the tendency to anthropomorphize is only going to increase. Analyses have shown that anthropomorphization of AI systems have changed the behavior of users significantly when compared to nonanthropomorphization systems (Cui, 2022; Uysal et al., 2023; Alabed et al., 2022; Festerling and Siraj, 2022; Crolic et al., 2022) . Most interestingly, Alabed et al. (2022) establish a conceptual link between anthropomorphization and self-congruence, which is the fit between the user's self-concept and the system's personality. This is of extreme importance because self-congruence increases the trust that a user has on the system (Sheehan et al., 2020; Choi et al., 2021; Yoganathan et al., 2021) . This is a concept that is extensively studied in marketing and consumer behavior and studies have shown that it can influence behaviors such as willingness to pay (Yoganathan et al., 2021) , customer satisfaction (Sheehan et al., 2020; Choi et al., 2021) , and trustworthiness (Wang and Scheinbaum, 2018) . As expected, the exact demographics of the personality associated with systems or brands plays a key role in self-congruence as well, with studies finding that the demographics of the logo or mascot associated with the brand like the gender (Choi et al., 2018; Edwards and La Ferle, 2009) or race (Whittler, 1991; Branchik and Chowdhury, 2017) have significant impact on self-congruence. Given that current LLMs are powerful enough to be bestowed specific demographic traits by simply modifying the system parameter, malicious actors can easily use this to their advantage by manipulating users into trusting the system. While anthropomorphization of systems itself is not malicious, it is thus important to understand exactly how it changes human-AI interaction. 5 Opportunities While anthropomorphization has issues, it also poses a suite of opportunities to improve democratization and accessibility of AI systems. In the past, it has been used as a tool to improve trustworthiness and acceptability of AI systems (Choung et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2018; Shin, 2022; Waytz et al., 2014) . With more AI systems being deployed in the real world, accessibility can be improved with constructive anthropomorphization encompassing features like using the native language of the user, assigning virtual personas which are familiar to the user, and making them more relatable and empathetic based on their preferences. In this work, we do not argue for outright anthropodenial (Bruni et al., 2018) , but rather a responsible way of using anthropomorphization which keeps safety and algorithmic equity at the forefront.

Its recent evolution retraces our own human evolution, only on a vastly accelerated scale. In the Beginning Was the Word Working with language seemed like it would be a simple task for computers. Given how easily machines compute complex math, how hard could it be? The answer turned out to be very. Traditional or Good Old Fashioned AI (GOFAI) focused on statistical patterns that required models carefully crafted by experts. The advent of Deep Learning, powered by advancements like Moore\u2019s Law and big data, enabled a paradigm shift that eliminated the need for explicit rules. Good Old Fashioned AI (GOFAI) vs Deep Learning With this new paradigm, some argued these Large Language Models (LLMs) only simulate understanding, much like \u201cstochastic parrots.\u201d Applied at scale, however, Deep Learning LLMs exhibit complex emergent properties, just as human biology arises from simple DNA. With scale, new capabilities appear, from summarization to theory of mind. Exploring the World Could true intelligence arise from a disembodied \u201cbrain in a vat\u201d? How much of our world can be captured by the words on which LLMs are trained? It turns out, more than we thought. ChatGPT, for instance, has demonstrated the ability to generate spatial maps. But to realize general intelligence, AI agents need embodiment to explore unconstrained environments and learn firsthand. This entails multi-modal AI capable of learning through multiple inputs like sight and sound. Today, AI robots are beginning to explore and interact with the world in just this way. Mastery of Tools LLMs, like humans, also have intrinsic limitations. Like us, their evolution leverages tool use and creation to overcome these. Current integration with external databases and search engines reduces so-called \u201challucinations.\u201d Plug-ins and APIs enable LLMs to write programs, send email, and manipulate complex symbolic models. Just as animal intelligence exploded after mastering tools, this stage could unlock an exponential takeoff in intelligence. With tools, AI could more easily engineer its own self-improvement and augment its capabilities beyond human comprehension. AI Gets Creative (and Emotional) AI now ventures into creative domains: art, music, and writing. Until recently, automation had largely replaced manual labor characterized as dirty and dangerous, difficult and dull. Generative AI can write and design, analyze and program. Intellectual property lawsuits and Hollywood writers\u2019 strikes are only isolated examples of looming disruptions. Alongside these creative powers comes emotional intelligence. Emotional Intelligence and AffectiveAI delve into recognizing, modeling, and influencing human emotions, forging a path toward more empathetic AI systems. Already, our connected devices feed data to hungry AffectiveAI models, and AI may soon know us better than we know ourselves. Once algorithms excel at modeling collective psychology, we may find our minds and behaviors shaped by forces beyond our awareness. AI as Social Agent Collectives Just as social collaboration propelled human civilization forward, a society of collaborative AI agents can orchestrate complex tasks with a symphony of specialized skills. Rather than one monolithic model, the latest natural language model, GPT-4, is likely a coordinated mixture of experts. Some theorists envision a future in which humans directly interface with AI collectives through brain-computer interfaces. More immediate questions involve how to align AI agents with human values. Conclusion Addressing the Human-AI value alignment problem is crucial to ensure the AIs we develop are in service to humanity. It\u2019s a pivotal moment for those of us in humanities and arts computing to have a voice in shaping our AI future. As the articles in this special volume on times of crisis make manifest, part of this influence lies in educating the next generation. There are a variety of interconnected questions that span the range of human experience and organization, and to study any of these in isolation is insufficient. But we also have a role to play in the coming conversations about the future of work, the limitations we may wish to place on artificial agents, and the ethical, legal and societal questions we now face. To ensure that the AIs we develop are in service to humanity, we must first solve the human-human alignment dilemma. Before we decide on values for our machines, we must first agree, however much we are able, on which values are shared by humans. We are grateful for journals like the International Journal Humanities and Arts Computing that provide forums to consider these questions. Arts and humanities computing is having a moment, and there is no better time, with the spotlight upon us, to do something with the moment that\u2019s been given us.

The challenge is knowing where to draw the line, and avoid imagining sentience or ascribing moral worth to AI. It\u2019s not easy. To summarize, we offer four thoughts. Developers should avoid behaviors that make it easy to anthropomorphize these tools, except in specific cases such as companion chatbots. Journalists should avoid clickbait headlines and articles that exacerbate this problem. Research on human-chatbot interaction is urgently needed. Finally, experts need to come up with a more nuanced message than \u201cdon\u2019t anthropomorphize AI\u201d. Perhaps the term anthropomorphize is so broad and vague that it has lost its usefulness when it comes to generative AI. Large language models (LLMs) have now achieved many of the longstanding goals of the quest for generalist AI, and they have done so with large-scale, neurally inspired, attention-enabled, unsupervised machine learning, as opposed to the code- and rule-based approaches that have repeatedly failed over the past half century. While LLMs are still very imperfect (though rapidly improving) in areas like factual grounding, planning, reasoning, safety, memory, and consistency, they do understand concepts, are capable of insight and originality, can problem-solve, and exhibit many faculties we have historically defended vigorously as exceptionally human, such as humor, creativity, and theory of mind. At this point, human responses to the emergence of AI seem to be telling us more about our own psychology, hopes and fears, than about AI itself. However, taking these new AI capacities seriously, and noticing that they all emerge purely from sequence modeling, should cause us to reassess what our own cerebral cortex is doing, and whether we are learning what intelligence, machine or biological, actually is. https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00754-x%7C A social path to human-like artificial intelligence 2023-11-17 Du\u00e9\u00f1ez-Guzm\u00e1n; Edgar A; Sadedin; Suzanne; Wang; Jane X; McKee; Kevin R; Leibo; Joel Z ReferencesKrizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I. & Hinton, G.

Given the success of contemporary learning algorithms, we argue that the bottleneck in artificial intelligence (AI) advancement is shifting from data assimilation to novel data generation. We bring together evidence showing that natural intelligence emerges at multiple scales in networks of interacting agents via collective living, social relationships and major evolutionary transitions, which contribute to novel data generation through mechanisms such as population pressures, arms races, Machiavellian selection, social learning and cumulative culture. Many breakthroughs in AI exploit some of these processes, from multi-agent structures enabling algorithms to master complex games such as Capture-The-Flag and StarCraft II, to strategic communication in the game Diplomacy and the shaping of AI data streams by other AIs. Moving beyond a solipsistic view of agency to integrate these mechanisms could provide a path to human-like compounding innovation through ongoing novel data generation.

Among the many questions this technology raises, people are vigorously pondering if these LLMs are not merely intelligent (i.e., high problem-solving ability) but are digital minds with mental capacities such as emotion, autonomy, socialization, meaning, language, and self-awareness. Digital minds may be a key factor in the way AI develops over the coming years, such that a better understanding may lead to more accurate forecasts, better strategic prioritization, and concrete strategies for AI safety. Here, I briefly scope out some key questions in this area that might be worth further research. This may be a promising way for social scientists to contribute to AI safety (see \u201cAI Safety Needs Social Scientists\u201d), though these questions also invoke philosophy, computer science, and other perspectives. What digital minds will exist in short- and long-term futures? There are many plausible ways for digital minds to emerge relatively soon in AIs such as the new wave of LLMs: ChatGPT, Sydney, Bard, Claude, and Sparrow. AIs already have reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), program synthesis, and the ability to call APIs, and the way minds emerge may depend on myriad social factors such as the different cultures and reputations of AI engineering teams across tech giants, start-ups, universities, and governments. Already in 2022, a few engineers saw neural nets as \u201csentient\u201d and said they \u201cmay be \u2026 slightly conscious.\u201d In the long run, there are many advantages to being a digital mind that could lead to their ubiquity, such as a better ability to copy and modify oneself. Forecasting which trajectories are most likely may draw from biology, computer science, cognitive science, economics, and other fields, as well as research directly interpreting and explaining current AIs. For example, without reinforcement learning, AIs may not have a multi-time-step reasoning that is necessary for some richer mental capacities, such as goal-directed behavior. On the other hand, given the marketability of LLMs, corporations may drive that technological progress most quickly, and the incentive to have AIs that can predict human behavior (e.g., personal assistants) may quickly lead to digital minds. These different sorts of digital minds may each require different approaches to alignment and existential safety. For example, digital minds with a fundamental capacity for linguistic meaning may be able to interpret human instructions and bootstrap their way into aligned outcomes with RLHF, while highly agentic minds with limited capacities of language and meaning may require more hard-coded alignment, such as neural causal models or agent foundations. These are just some concrete examples of many factors that could drive forecasts related to digital minds, which could complement forecasting of economic trends by MIT FutureTech, compute trends by Epoch, and Metaculus prediction markets. How will humans react to digital minds? Reactions to actual or perceived digital minds may play an important role in existential risks from AI. People are already reacting strongly to those dialogue-based LLMs. Mind attribution may effect a rapid increase in AI investments, a shift in prioritization among AI architectures, a Ludditic backlash against AI progress, campaigns to protect the interests of AI, existential reflection among humans, etc. Human reactions have been the focus of most Sentience Institute research to date, such as the ongoing Artificial Intelligence, Morality, and Sentience (AIMS) nationally representative survey of US public attitudes, a survey of predictors of moral consideration of AIs in Computers in Human Behavior, and preprints of experiments on perspective-taking and the effect of different features (e.g., embodiment, emotion expression) on moral consideration. Further research should draw on cognitive and social psychology as well as macro social science across political, media, and social movement theory. For example, mind perception theory suggests that attribution of agentic mental capacity is associated with attribution of moral agency\u2014the ability to take moral action, to create benefit and harm\u2014while experience is associated with moral patiency (i.e., moral circle expansion); thus, humans may react to more agentic minds with more concern and resistance. Similarly, studies in human-robot interaction suggest that autonomy, humanness, and outperformance make humans feel more threatened. One particularly important dimension may be the extent to which advanced AI systems appear to be aligned, such as through RLHF, even if the underlying model is not viewed as safe and aligned by well-informed researchers. At the macro scale, the history of how historical social movements emerge and succeed can evidence how collective action may occur following the recognition of digital minds, particularly the presence of mental capacities in a technological artifact, may create a trajectory that recombines features of social movements and other emerging technologies. Research can also address the extent of value lock-in with various reflection and alignment mechanisms, and thus how and to what extent we should ensure moral progress before takeoff. What is the philosophical nature of digital minds? Arguably, most digital minds research to date has been in a cluster of philosophy of mind, ethics, and law\u2014arguably since the 1920 science fiction play R.U.R. raised questions of robot rights. The first usage of the term \u201cdigital minds\u201d in this context that I know of was Ben Goertzel\u2019s The Hidden Pattern (2006), which presents a patternist theory of how biological and digital minds work. Much of this literature centers mental capacities such as consciousness, following the ethics literature on human and nonhuman animals, as well as relational theories that emphasize the social connections we have to AIs, most notably in Robot Rights (Gunkel 2018). We survey the ethics literature, broadly construed, in Harris and Anthis (2021). Our recent paper, Ladak (2023) in AI and Ethics, catalogs nine criteria that have been proposed for moral standing, emphasizing non-sentient AIs who arguably still have preferences and goals and thus may warrant moral consideration. Digital minds may have very different values and preferences from humans, such as less emphasis on self-preservation and mortal urgency, and we have cataloged some relevant features for assessing sentience in artificial entities. Properly including AIs in the moral circle could improve human-AI relations, reduce human-AI conflict, and reduce the likelihood of human extinction from rogue AI. Moral circle expansion to include the interests of digital minds could facilitate better relations between a nascent AGI and its creators, such that the AGI is more likely to follow instructions and the various optimizers involved in AGI-building are more likely to be aligned with each other. Empirically and theoretically, it seems very challenging to robustly align systems that have an exclusionary relationship such as oppression, abuse, cruelty, or slavery. A number of philosophers and scientists have written about whether artificial consciousness is possible. In a recent review, we find an affirmative consensus, though division remains on its plausibility, especially due to differences between computational, physical, and biological approaches. Progress on this question may be largely tied up in broader challenges in a philosophical understanding of consciousness, such as resolving debates between realism and eliminativism, and the developments of scientific theories such as global workspace and attention schema. David Chalmers has recently taken up the question of consciousness in language models, covering features such as memory and global workspaces, and philosophy of mind seems to be the main topic for digital minds group at FHI, such as Shulman and Bostrom (2020) on superbeneficiaries\u2014though Bostrom and Shulman\u2019s \u201cPropositions Concerning Digital Minds and Society\u201d (2022) covers a wider range of topics\u2014as well as for MEP, CFM, GCRI, and most other academic groups in this nascent field. How will digital minds interact, and what kind of society will that create? Given individual differences between digital and biological minds, there may be radically different social dynamics, such as the wide range of predictions made in The Age of Em (Hanson 2016) for a world of whole brain emulations and the conceptual analysis of simulations in Reality+ (Chalmers 2022). Further work could focus on economic, organizational, or political dynamics, such as trade-offs between AI augmenting or automating human labor, \u201csuper democratized\u201d access to multiple AGIs, or multipolar takeoff scenarios in which transformative AIs cooperate or conflict. This includes a number of ways in which the long-term future could go very well or very poorly. The consideration of mental capacities other than intelligence may complicate a variety of social theories, such as: game theory with fewer bounds on rationality and cooperation; decision theory with access to other agents\u2019 source code (a la functional decision theory); social choice theory if individuals can quickly copy themselves; organizational and economic theory if the locus of agency is no longer individuals but groups of (near-)copies; and legal and rights theories with digital environments that are easier to surveil, manipulate, and abuse than analog environments. The social dynamics of digital minds, in groups of exclusively digital minds and in hybrid biological-digital groups (e.g., the first digital minds and their human creators), could precipitate very rapid increases in AI capabilities and lead to radically different takeoff scenarios and long-term futures. What strategies are most promising for improving futures with digital minds? All of the foundational research outlined above needs to ultimately be cashed out in better strategies for building the best future for all sentient beings. One tentative strategic claim is that research should be prioritized before other projects such as public policy or outreach. First impressions may be very important for digital minds as with other technosocial issues (e.g., lock-in of GMO and nuclear energy narratives), and there has been so little research on this topic that the most promising outreach strategies could easily change after only a few research projects. Before promoting a narrative or policy goal, such as a moratorium on digital consciousness, we should consider its direct viability and indirect effects of its promotion. Delay should not be too long, however, because suboptimal narratives may take over in the meantime, especially with short timelines\u2014making digital minds research a highly time-sensitive AI safety project. Discussion to date has arguably been largely confused and quite possibly detrimental. The most promising work informed by digital minds research may be preparation to push forcefully for certain technical and governance strategies during major advances in AI capabilities. FAQ What makes this different from other AI existential safety research? That\u2019s a tough question. As with most research clusters, distinctions are more in focus, methods, and family resemblance than crisp conceptual boundaries. In practice, this agenda is more oriented towards social science and towards complex, high-level topics than paradigms such as mechanistic interpretability and agent foundations. For example, rather than approaching \u201cagency\u201d with bottom-up infra-Bayesianism, DM research would tend towards social models of agency\u2014how agents work together and attribute agency to each other\u2014and utilize social science rather than mathematical tools. Also, many AI safety research agendas have a safe AI architecture in mind (e.g., IDA), but DM does not. It is better viewed as a question-centric agenda (e.g., \u201cHow can we elicit latent knowledge?\u201d) or a specific stream of forecasting (i.e., marginal and conditional probabilities of particular AI futures). And because it is a high-level approach not specific to an architecture or technical implementation, it may be more robustly useful across possible AI takeoff scenarios, at least those in which AGI has a richer mental life\u2014though by the same token, it may lack the sharp contribution to specific AI takeoff scenarios. How fixed is this agenda? Not at all. There are some exciting individual projects already happening in this nascent field, and now the idea is to zoom out and write this research agenda to figure out which orientations, questions, and clusters of projects seem most promising\u2014if any. We will continue to iterate between concrete big-picture planning and concrete progress on the most promising individual projects, but overall, this new field seems very promising at the moment. How can I work on digital minds (DM) research? This work is now our primary focus at the Sentience Institute. We have substantial room for more funding; we are eager to establish a network of DM research collaborators and advisors (get in touch); and we are accepting researcher applications on a rolling basis!

I\u2019ll let you go read it. When you come back, a few thoughts: * None of this is, strictly speaking, new: as Prof. Susan Brennan says in her commentary (also shared by Chenhao Tan), \u201cthis debate is as old as the hills\u201d; at the same time, \u201cthe debate has quite a different urgency today.\u201d * As you probably know by now, I tend to side with Prof. Shneiderman. Chenhao Tan and Justin D. Weisz summarize Prof. Shneiderman\u2019s perspective with his appeal to designers and developers to \u201ctake responsibility for AI-infused tools\u201d, which I support in full. As Elizabeth Weil wrote in her profile of Prof. Emily M. Bender , \u201cBlurring the line [between chatbots and people] is dangerous. A society with counterfeit people we can\u2019t differentiate from real ones will soon be no society at all.\u201d * The conversation with Mark Wiemer in the comment thread prompted me to go back to the big debate of the last - what? - 7-8 years or so, about algorithmic feeds in social media: one of the most successful ever applications of AI and one that billions of people have had direct experience with. I expect that the moral ambiguity and dangers of chatbots pretending to be humans will be an order of magnitude bigger than the moral ambiguity and dangers posed by algorithmic feeds . I won\u2019t rehash the whole conversation, but here is the comment thread if you\u2019re curious. * The question is now how we get this conversation from the research world to the leadership of the companies that develop LLMs and their user interfaces. I don\u2019t have a good answer - and, based on precedent, I am not optimistic: we still, after all, have algorithmic feeds prompting people to go down the most bizarre, damaging and sometimes illegal rabbit holes of content. So this is not an issue that engineers alone can solve, or that lawmakers can solve by calling engineers to testify in Congress. I think we need economists at the table, because they study incentives and outcomes depending on the rules of the game. AI is an arms\u2019 race - where is the equilibrium? And, of course, designers and developers must escalate to their leaders. (Fiction) reading suggestions and some fun with \u201cManna\u201d In the past few months, I\u2019ve often thought of a short novel on AI risks and opportunities that a former colleague recommended to me years ago (Stefano A.: if you\u2019re reading, thank you!) The novel is Manna \u2013 Two Views of Humanity\u2019s Future by Marshall Brain: it was written in 2003, it\u2019s quite short (you can read it in one evening), and if you\u2019re not interested in the slim book as a physical object, keep in mind that the author has made the text widely available for free. The two views of humanity\u2019s future are, of course, a stark, bleak, scarcity-plagued total dystopia and a perfect, blessed, abundance-fueled total utopia, both made possible by AI, depending on how humans decide to use it. I won\u2019t deprive you of the pleasure of reading the book, but I will report that I spent some time fighting with chatbots interfacing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in order to have the novel correctly summarized, and I was defeated. You will by now be familiar with the scenario: whether I used the consumer version or the luxury version, factual errors sneaked into the summary, names of characters and places were arbitrarily changed, crucial plot points were ignored, and when the machine was called on a mistake, it remedied it with text containing another mistake. (Whoever wrote the Wikipedia page for Manna , I believe, did a better job, in comparison, although they could expand a bit more on the utopian scenario). The most extraordinary answer I received from the machine, after much \u201cplease try again, considering X and Y\u201d prodding from my side, went along these lines (I know, it was in the free version - I should have foreseen it) (emphasis mine): Unfortunately, as an AI language model, my responses are generated based on pre-existing knowledge and do not have access to specific details or plot points from unpublished works , such as \"Manna.\" As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Marshall Brain had not released a novel titled \"Manna.\" Therefore, I am unable to provide an accurate summary or details about [X] or [Y] [note by Paola: I have removed spoilers] . It's possible that you may be referring to a different work or a future publication by the author. I know your answer - easily fixable, nothing to see here, it won\u2019t happen again. True. But my gut reaction? Chat-GPT is gaslighting me . And my second thought? There isn\u2019t anybody gaslighting me there, so I\u2019m not going to feel gaslighted, or gaslit, whatever. My third thought? Who knows what Marshall Brain would say... More (fiction) reading Salvatore Sanfilippo is an Italian programmer best known in the open source community for the Redis data structures server. Lately, he has tried his hand at writing fiction, and the result is an imperfect but charming sci-fi novel called WOHPE (2022). In WOHPE , humanity in a crisis reluctantly returns to AI after a 20-year hiatus due to a ban on the most powerful and dangerous models. But the solution does not lie in silicon-based structures alone\u2026 it involves biology. I assume readers are as eagerly expecting the sequel as I am. I\u2019ll admit that my tastes are eclectic. I also read The Years by 2022 Nobel Prize winner Annie Ernaux. What an extraordinary book. Finally, I am embroiled in a big, sprawling, navel-gazing novel by Mircea C\u0103rt\u0103rescu, Solenoid , which I only recommend if you\u2019re curious about how a rich inner life of dreams, nightmares, hallucinations and apparitions helped the protagonist/author get through life in Bucarest in the 1970s and 1980s. Its relevance here is twofold. First, in Chapter 30 the protagonist muses about Borges\u2019s story \"Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\", which I quoted from in this post . Second, the text he quotes starts with this passage, which appears in the fictitious postscript (emphasis mine): In March of 1941 a letter written by Gunnar Erfjord was discovered in a book by Hinton which had belonged to Herbert Ashe. The envelope was postmarked Ouro Preto; the mystery of Tl\u00f6n was fully elucidated by the letter. This gives C\u0103rt\u0103rescu the hook for a long digression about Hinton, a mathematician and writer whose efforts to help people imagine the fourth spatial dimension Solenoid describes in lengthy and fascinated detail. That would be Charles Howard Hinton: he married Mary Ellen Boole, the daughter of educator and mathematician Mary Everest Boole and George Boole, the founder of mathematical logic. One of Charles and Mary Ellen\u2019s sons was George Hinton, who became a mining engineer and botanist (another one was Sebastian Hinton, whose daughter was Joan Hinton, a nuclear physicist and one of the few women scientists who worked for the Manhattan Project). George\u2019s son was entomologist Howard Everest Hinton. Howard, in turn, was the father of\u2026 Geoffrey Everest Hinton : yes, the neural network pioneer and \u201cGodfather of AI\u201d who left Google a few weeks ago (which you probably read about here ) so he can freely speak out about the risks of AI. More perspectives on LLMs from writers and researchers In case you need to catch up, over the past few weeks Jaron Lanier , Ted Chiang and Naomi Klein - among many others - have written about AI and society. Is AI becoming synoymous with hyper-capitalism? And what can be done about it?Policymakers - before they act - could probably do worse than re-read (or read) the simple parable in Manna by Marshall Brain. That\u2019s it for this issue.

But join me in this journey by buying this book's Early Access Preview / Work In Progress. It has around 400+ pages now, but I am working to detail my thoughts and refine them.This book is written with the assistance of AI tools. This allows an unparalleled new way of exploring ideas more profoundly and creating an entirely new synthesis.You can now have a conversation with the book via GPT and Claude (via Poe).This book explores a wide span of theoretical perspectives related to cognition, language, reasoning, creativity, and meaning-making. It integrates ideas from philosophy, psychology, linguistics, and other fields to paint a rich picture of the human mind and its phenomenology.The early chapters ground the exploration in philosophical notions of meaning and consciousness. Charles Peirce\u2019s semiotics provides a framework for analyzing signs, symbols, and representation. His concept of abductive reasoning is linked to creativity and hypothesis formation, while his idea of architectonics speaks to the interrelations between different domains of knowledge. Process philosophy examines metaphysical questions about the nature of reality and mind.Building on these philosophical foundations, the sections on language, reasoning and social cognition dive deeper into how individuals coordinate meaning and share intentionality through collective linguistic and normative structures. Theories by Daniel Dor and Michael Tomasello highlight the profoundly social aspects of human language, reasoning, and cumulative culture. The intersubjective construction of shared imaginative landscapes enables complex cooperation, communication, and knowledge.Language and reasoning are then examined not as solipsistic mental functions but intrinsically social technologies evolved for collective sense-making, justification, and coordination. Thinkers from Wittgenstein to Dor describe language acquisition as interactive apprenticeship into publicly negotiated conventions that shape our conceptual landscape. Theories of reasoning similarly see it as emerging from intuitive processes honed for communicative exchange of arguments, not detached logical analysis.This social foundation sets the stage for delving into cognitive dynamics and transformations. The enactive approach views cognition as emerging through active embrace of tensions and uncertainties within precarious \u201clinguistic bodies\u201d. Relevance realization adapts to context through tradeoffs between competing constraints and salience factors. Bohm\u2019s \u201crheomode\u201d aims to reshape language itself to better attune with thought's fluid, creative movement.The discussion then turns to cognitive dynamics and transformations involved in design, conversation, computation, attention, and relevance realization. Concepts of semantic closure, cognitive tension, tradeoffs, and constraints reveal the complex, embodied processes by which minds enact meaning, converse, and creatively adapt. Notions of cybernetics, enactivism, and dynamic systems provide models for understanding cognition as an emergent, recursive process negotiating varied practical and communicative demands.Finally, the closing sections relate these conceptual models of mind and meaning to applied concerns like guiding behavior, dissolving paradoxes, developing maturity, and expanding compassion. Theories of cognitive development, paradoxical wisdom, pattern languages, and worldview integration speak to possible avenues for continued human progress through contemplative, compassionate, creative reason.Taken together, the diverse collection of perspectives and ideas in this volume illuminate the human mind as profoundly shaped by embodied tensions, social-linguistic scaffolding, pragmatic needs, and aspirations to truth, beauty, and justice. The synthesis reveals cognition\u2019s marvelous complexity while providing philosophical vision and practical tools to better understand what it means to be human in a diverse, interconnected world.Across these multifaceted explorations, common themes emerge around embodiment, imagination, dynamism, and sociality as crucial yet neglected elements of language, meaning, [Friday evening short video] I'm summarizing a paper that caught my attention this week: \"Role play with large language models\" by @mpshanahan, McDonell & Reynolds Not technical!

Atoosa Kasirzadeh Finton Kasirzadeh Regina Mallory Eric Rini Luke Schwitzgebel Karina Stark An-Nette Vold Zimmermann ChatGPT, Large Language Technologies, and the Bumpy Road of Benefiting Humanity 21 Apr 2023* In DailyNous -March 16, 2023 -\"Philosophers on Next-Generation Large Language Models\" series, edited by Annette Zimmermann. Contributions by Abeba Birhane, Atoosa 1 From tech moguls in Silicon Valley to those who have the luxury of indulging in the exploration of cutting-edge AI technologies, OpenAI's ChatGPT has captured the imagination of many with its conversational AI capabilities. The large language models that underpin ChatGPT and similar language technologies rely on vast amounts of textual data and alignment procedures to generate responses that can sometimes leave users pondering whether they're interacting with a piece of technology or a human. While some view making language agents such as Chat-GPT merely as a significant step in developing AI for linguistic tasks, others view it as a vital milestone in the ambitious pursuit of achieving artificial general intelligence -AI systems that are generally more intelligent than humans. In a recent blogpost OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, emphasizes the ambitious role of this tech- nology as a step towards building \"artificial general intelligence\" that \"benefits all of humanity.\" ChatGPT promises to enhance efficiency and productivity with its remarkable capabilities. One impressive feature is its ability to summarize texts. Impressive outputs, ChatGPT! For some people, these results might look like watching a magician pull a rabbit out of a hat. However, we must address a few 2 small problems with these two summaries: the events described did not happen. Sam Altman did not agree with Emily Bender in 2018 about humans being stochastic parrots; the discussion regarding the relationship between stochastic parrots, language models, and human's natural language processing capacities only got off the ground in a 2021 paper \"on the dangers of stochastic parrots: can language models be too big?\" [1]. Indeed, in 2022 Altman tweeted that we are stochastic parrots (perhaps sarcastically). Similarly, there is no public record of David Chalmers giving a speech at the United Nations in 2019. Additionally, the first arXiv link in the bibliography takes us to the following preprint, which is neither written by David Chalmers nor is titled \"The Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?\" The second bibliography link takes us to a page that cannot be found. These examples illustrate that outputs from ChatGPT and other similar language models can include content that deviates from reality and can be considered hallucinatory. While some researchers may find value in the generation of such content, citing the fact that humans also produce imaginative content, others may associate this with the ability of large language models to engage in counterfactual reasoning. However, it is important to recognize that the inaccuracies and 3 tendency of ChatGPT to produce hallucinatory content can have severe negative consequences, both epistemically and socially. Therefore, we should remain cautious in justifying the value of such content and consider the potential harms that may arise from its use. Ongoing research in AI ethics and safety is progressing to minimize the potential harms of ChatGPT-style technologies and implement mitigation strategies to ensure safe systems. 1 These are all promising developments. However, despite some progress being made in AI safety and ethics, we should avoid oversimplifying the promises of artificial intelligence \"benefiting all of humanity\". The alignment of ChatGPT and other (advanced) AI systems with human values faces numerous challenges. 2 One challenge is that human values can be in conflict with one another. For example, we might not be able to make conversational agents that are simultaneously maximally helpful and maximally harmless. Choices are made about how to trade-off between these conflicting values, and there are many ways to aggregate the diverse perspectives of choice makers. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider which values and whose values we align language technologies with and on what legitimate grounds these values are preferred over other alternatives. Another challenge is that while recent advances in AI research may bring us closer to achieving some dimensions of human-level intelligence, we must remember that intelligence is a multidimensional concept. While we have made great strides in natural language processing and image recognition, we are still far from developing technologies that embody unique qualities that make us human-our capacity to resist, to gradually change, to be courageous, and to achieve Absolutely loving this zinger from @ZeerakTalat and friends about the dangers of anthropomorphizing AI systems -- it does an amazing job at explaining all of the risks that come with it!

provides you with some new perspectives and unexpected threads. That is why today, I want to give you a few unconventional viewpoints on AI. Because in case you haven\u2019t noticed, AI seems to finally be ready to disrupt basically everything as we find ourselves in the midst of a technological revolution of unparalleled proportions. So, you might have already seen lots of prompt engineering advice\u2026 \u201cChatGPT can save you hours of time at work. But only if you use these top 10 prompts\u2026\u201d or jaw-dropping predictions\u2026 \u201c80% of US workers will be impacted by GPT\u201d and astonishing new AI-driven apps\u2026. \u201cRunway is a new kind of creative suite where AI is a collaborator and anything you can imagine can be created.\u201d But I want to take you on a journey through some more out-of-the-box ideas regarding AI. So sit down, and let\u2019s explore some exciting AI rabbit holes! \u201c[\u2026] The modern version of \u201cintelligence\u201d [\u2026] came to be understood as a capacity for ordered, rational, problem-solving, pattern-recognizing cognition. [\u2026] Both intelligence and agency are habitually identified as universal human attributes, part of the very definition of what it means to be human. But both are actually grounded firmly in the lived experience of one particular human group.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s understandable that elite European scholars and gentlemen, trying to interrogate and apprehend what constituted humanity, should use their own experience as a basis for their studies. But their perspectives were necessarily limited. If asked, would their servants have pointed to free will as the defining element of their humanity? What about their slaves? Or their wives?\u201d \u201cThe progress of artificial intelligence is also measured against the human yardstick [\u2026]. Again, the idea of what constitutes \u201cintelligence\u201d closely resembles the earlier 19th-century model of rational, logical analysis. Key research goals [in AI], for example, focus on reasoning, problem-solving, pattern recognition and the capacity to map the relationship between concepts, objects and strategies. \u201cIntelligence\u201d here is cognitive, rational and goal-directed. It is not, for example, kinesthetic (based on embodiment and physical memory) or playful. Nor \u2014 despite the best efforts of Rosalind Picard and some others \u2014 does it usually include emotion or affect.\u201d \u201c[\u2026] Perhaps as a result, people tend to fear the consequences of AI. [\u2026] All these debates about intelligence and the human future are based on the assumption that intelligence is fundamentally rational and goal-directed \u2014 that is, that the 19th-century understanding of the concept is still the most appropriate interpretation of what it is. What if it isn\u2019t? And what about agency? What if agency isn\u2019t self-conscious, or even based in an individual?\u201d Intelligence = Play & Emotion: \u201cBy the end of the 20th century, studies of learning and decision-making began to note the importance of play and the significance of emotion to the development of both intelligence and agency. It became clear that emotion is central to the process of learning: It influences attention, retention and reasoning. [\u2026] In the 1960s, [\u2026] Jean Piaget argued that play was central to learning, enabling children to familiarize themselves with skills and scenarios in safe environments. More recent ethological work on non-human animals confirms that individuals who play more are more successful (in terms of individual life span and reproductive success) than those who don\u2019t \u2014 although the precise mechanisms linking play with these outcomes remain unclear.\u201d Intelligence = Stories & Imagination: \u201cEven more importantly, when it comes to considering both AI and risk, researchers have recently begun to pay a lot more attention to the significance of stories when it comes to understanding public behaviors and decision-making. [\u2026] The startling growth of both the range and size of digital and analog entertainment platforms has demonstrated the economic weight of the imagination. Play, it turns out, is serious work. Fairy tales may well prove more useful than factor analysis in understanding human agency in the Anthropocene. This is because stories are vitally important in both explaining and expanding an individual\u2019s understanding of a situation. Particularly in the past decade, the West has seen how stories (myths, post-truths, history) help form collective community identities, which can sometimes exacerbate inter-community tension.\u201d Intelligence = Cooperation: \u201cDiscussion of agency in traditional economics and philosophy usually focuses on competition and the role of the (rational) individual. But when it comes down to it, one of the most distinctive and universal characteristics of humanity is our ability to cooperate. This capacity is literally built into our biology. Without cooperation, without the ability to form alliances, women would not be able to give birth or raise children: We would become extinct as a species.\u201d \u201cEven more significantly [\u2026] we cooperate across species lines. Our capacity to form close bonds with dogs, for example, may have been a key factor in enabling Homo sapiens to out-compete other hominid species [\u2026]. [\u2026] In many ways, the Anthropocene can be understood as the expression of collective multispecies agency: Without companion animals and livestock, industrial society could never have developed. It\u2019s not an accident that we still speak of an engine\u2019s \u201chorsepower,\u201d or turn to puppies for companionship in the middle of a devastating pandemic.\u201d \u201c[So] when it comes to anticipating what artificial intelligence might look like or do, we urgently need to get beyond our limited idea of what constitutes intelligence.\u201d As I hinted at in last week\u2019s Rabbit Hole, Generative AI opens up the opportunity to move from an Age of Average (that\u2019s us right now) to an Age of Creativity. And I think that these tools also help us to create more products and services that are based on the Design for Emergence philosophy: Design for Emergence is\u2026 \u2026open-ended and permissionless. Resulting designs are often surprising, something the original designer could have never imagined. \u2026context-adabtable. The end-user can integrate their local or contextual knowledge \u2026composable. It provides a basic \u2018language and grammar\u2019 that\u2019s easy to learn and employ, but can also extended and result in highly complex applications. More on this design concept in this issue from last year. But now, let\u2019s actually look at some visually-pleasing examples of \u201cCreativity On Steroids\u201d: Found the following music video thanks to Rodrigo\u2019s amazing The Nexialist newsletter: Nick St. Pierre is my go-to guy for mastering Midjourney. Just look at these two images that he created with the AI: Prompt: 1990s medium-full street style fashion photo shot on Kodak 500T capturing a rugged 50-year-old man with curly gray hair, 5-o'clock shadow, and a stern look walking down the sidewalk on a bright spring morning in Paris. He's wearing worn-down Carhart apparel with a leather carpentry tool belt. Careful composition and morning mist. --ar 3:2 Prompt: 1960s street style fashion photo capturing a gorgeous 30-year-old woman with long brown hair, slightly blush cheeks, and a sly grin walking confidently on a bright spring morning in TriBeCa. She's wearing a stunning white lace Gucci gown with a full tulle skirt, intricate lace detailing, long lace sleeves, a high collar, and a fitted bodice adorned with delicate floral appliques. The soft lighting and careful composition emphasize the dreamy and romantic elegance of the gown. --ar 17:22 The new Runway mobile app. Wow! The improvements within just one year: \u201c[\u2026] An artificial-intelligence gold rush has started over the last several months to mine the anticipated business opportunities from generative AI models like ChatGPT. \u201cYou can practically hear the shrieks from corner offices around the world: \u2018What is our ChatGPT play? How do we make money off this?\u2019\u201d \u201cFor all the amazing advances in AI and other digital tools over the last decade, their record in improving prosperity and spurring widespread economic growth is discouraging. Although a few investors and entrepreneurs have become very rich, most people haven\u2019t benefited. Some have even been automated out of their jobs.\u201d \u201cProductivity growth, which is how countries become richer and more prosperous, has been dismal since around 2005 in the US and in most advanced economies (the UK is a particular basket case). The fact that the economic pie is not growing much has led to stagnant wages for many people.\u201d \u201cThe worry is not so much that ChatGPT will lead to large-scale unemployment\u2014as Autor points out, there are plenty of jobs in the US\u2014but that companies will replace relatively well-paying white-collar jobs with this new form of automation, sending those workers off to lower-paying service employment while the few who are best able to exploit the new technology reap all the benefits.\u201d \u201cIn this scenario, tech-savvy workers and companies could quickly take up the AI tools, becoming so much more productive that they dominate their workplaces and their sectors. Those with fewer skills and little technical acumen to begin with would be left further behind.\u201d \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t think we should take it as the technology is loose on the world and we must adapt to it. Because it\u2019s in the process of being created, it can be used and developed in a variety of ways,\u2019 says Autor. \u2018It\u2019s hard to overstate the importance of designing what it\u2019s there for.\u2019 \u201cInteraction with AI is becoming second nature to us.\u201d \u201cThis means that how we interface with technology is changing dramatically, and these shifts don\u2019t happen very often; mobile may be the most recent interface revolution on this scale, over a decade ago.\u201d \u201cThe AI revolution is happening\u2014fast. In a few years, it will sound silly to call a company \u201can AI company\u201d just as it sounds silly today to call a company \u201ca mobile company.\u201d AI will be part of everything.\u201d \u201cThat said, there will be AI-native companies, just as there were mobile-native companies in the 2010s\u2014examples just from the home screen of my phone: Instagram, Snap, Uber, TikTok, and Robinhood. The massive shift in interfaces creates an opportunity for the startups, the AI-natives, and a vulnerability for the incumbents, the AI-adopters.\u201d \u201cConsumers tend to prefer things that are fast and convenient. AI interfaces will promise an improved user experience on both fronts. I expect that fewer consumers will be loyal to brands than businesses think they will be. I also expect that brands that require trust will be tougher to disrupt. Airbnb, for instance, has trust around staying in a stranger\u2019s home; knowing your AI chatbot booked through a reputable service will be important. A more commoditized service\u2014where your paper towels come from, for instance\u2014may be more easily disrupted. There are plenty of examples we could give here. The point is: AI is a radical new paradigm for interacting with businesses. We might not visit websites or open apps nearly as much anymore. Those have been our ports to the web\u2026forever. Or at least since the modern digital age was born. We haven\u2019t seen this much change in technology interfaces in a long, long time. In an interface revolution, everyone becomes vulnerable, new behaviors emerge, and tremendous value all of a sudden becomes ripe for the taking.\u201d Freeing Ourselves From Screens: \u201cEntitled \u201cChange Everything\u201d, the stunning one minute video offers an enigmatic first look at what the company could be building. Directed by Ryan Staake with music by Nas featuring Kanye West & The Dream, the newly released film [by Humane, a stealth startup co-founded by an ex-Apple designer and engineer] portrays a young woman escaping a sea of lost souls enslaved to their devices (including mobile, VR headsets, and wrist worn accessories, which I\u2019ll presume are smart watches). She\u2019s the only person awake to the natural world around her, looking upward at the sky rather than down at a glass slab. The protagonist leaves the crowd behind entering a lush forest as she follows the light of an eclipse. She stretches her palm towards the eclipse \u2014 which coincidentally is in the shape of Humane\u2019s logo \u2014 and when she turns her arm back around towards her body, the eclipse logo has now been transferred and projected onto the palm of her hand. Interestingly, she is still looking upward, heads up, to the projection in her hand and the world around her, in stark contrast to the zombies she left behind, with their slumped body language, fully consumed by and engrossed in their devices.\u201d \u201cThe attention economy, as it has come to be known, is the competition for our limited attention as it grows ever more valuable in the digital age. It\u2019s the ethos that drove Netflix CEO Reed Hastings to declare in 2017 that one of their primary competitors is sleep. [\u2026] Now, the same mix of factors is shaping the industries emerging around generative AI, driving toward outcomes that may prove toxic in a different way.\u201d \u201cSince both AI and more conventional tech lack business model diversity, they might also share a remedy: public options, or tax-funded alternatives. \u2018Business model diversity is an important part of the rich variety that capitalism can bring you,\u2019 says Diane Coyle, an economist at the University of Cambridge and former advisor to the UK Treasury. Merely breaking up the tech giants doesn\u2019t go far enough, she argues. In addition, we should create public options, like the BBC in media. Public options introduce a new kind of business model into their industries, leading to different incentives, and ultimately, wider competition. More diversity means more innovation, and better odds that these industries might evolve toward socially desirable outcomes.\u201d \u201cThe key point would be having a different business model competing in the ecosystem with different kinds of incentives. That might then tilt the incentives of all of the other companies. Forgive the economists' term, but you would start to see product differentiation. There\u2019d be more of a spectrum, broadening out the offer rather than narrowing down. As a British person I\u2019m drawing on the BBC, which has a publicly funded model. Because it doesn't need to hunt for advertising, that means that other broadcasters who are advertising-funded compete on quality. So it's all about putting a different kind of plant into the jungle to change the incentive structures and modify behavior. It's worked really well in broadcast, we've got a really healthy ecosystem, which helps Britain export massively in the creative industries. Now, would it work in the digital world? We don't know. But it seems to me worth exploring that idea.\u201d \u201cWhile Piketty looked back at the historically cumulative causes of inequality, he didn\u2019t much look forward to the impact of technological innovation, which is divorcing productivity growth and wealth creation from employment and income. To the extent that intelligent machines don\u2019t displace whole categories of jobs and depress wages, coworking with such technologies will offer few openings for the non-college educated. Those whose job it will be to monitor and manage generative AI like GPT3 will have to be smarter than it is.\u201d \u201cThe bottom line is that it is not those earning a wage income from manually fabricating microchips, which process the algorithms of AI, who will reap the compounding value from productivity-enhancing and wealth-generating intelligent machines. It will be the investors with an equity stake in those companies that own them.\u201d \u201cPolicies that aim for greater equality through only increasing the labor share of income are stuck in paradigm inertia rooted in the zero-sum class struggles of a more labor-intensive industrial era, which no longer characterizes the tech-driven economy. The new paradigm for the rapidly approaching future would seek a greater labor share of wealth through an ownership stake that captures more of the value created by intelligent machines, which are diminishing the prospect of gainful employment. Both must work in tandem to raise wealth from the bottom up. Platform Cooperatives as a Solution: \u201cAs the technology sector sends us hurtling toward a world of robots and artificial intelligence, \u201ctechnological unemployment\u201d becomes the threat as automation replaces jobs faster than we come up with new work for people to do. We will be left scrambling to find alternative sources of income for average people. Those decreases in salaries, wages, and benefits also increase corporate profitability and the investment income that profitability generates for shareholders. Automation thus shrinks employment income while growing investment income. That means that strategies for radically broadening ownership will play an extremely important role in mitigating the threat of wide-scale declines in income from technological unemployment. That\u2019s why extending cooperatives into the technology sector is so critical and where platform co-ops can play a vital role.\u201d \u201cAs automation and artificial intelligence cost jobs in one economic sector after another, employment-related income shrinks and investment income expands, exacerbating wealth disparity. Platform co-ops alter that equation by broadening the ownership of the companies that build and operate these technologies. A platform co-op alternative to Airbnb, for example, might use artificial intelligence and might need few employees. But it would be owned by, and share dividends with, its property-listing members\u2014perhaps even renters [\u2026].\u201d \u201cWe are in a race that pits the explosion of artificial intelligence and automation against our ability to rapidly expand ownership of the engines that drive this technological revolution. Growing platform cooperatives from their nascent form today into a thriving new sector is a critical step toward a fair and vibrant economic future.\u201d The video below by the Center for Humane Technology (producers of The Social Dilemma movie) is a must-see! As with any kind of powerful technology that\u2019s linked to destructive capitalism, we are, unfortunately, already building a monster that will be hard, if not impossible, to tame. Here are a few screenshots and quotes from the presentation by Tristan Harris & Aza Raskin. But again, you should definitely watch the entire video (see below): \"When you invent a new technology, you uncover a new class of responsibilities.\" First Contact with AI and the challenges it led to: Second Contact with AI and the challenges it is already or will eventually lead to: \u201cAll content-based verification will break this year.\u201d Great intentions and positives can eventually lead to systemic monsters: \u201c50% of AI researchers believe there is a 10% or greater chance that humans go extinct from our inability to control AI\u201d 2022 AI Impacts Survey \u2026would you still board the plane? The full presentation: \u201cWith the aid of digital bioacoustics \u2013 tiny, portable digital recorders similar to those found in your smartphone \u2013 researchers are documenting the universal importance of sound to life on Earth.\u201d \u201cBy placing these digital microphones all over Earth, from the depths of the ocean to the Arctic and the Amazon, scientists are discovering the hidden sounds of nature, many of which occur at ultrasonic or infrasonic frequencies, above or below human hearing range. Non-humans are in continuous conversation, much of which the naked human ear cannot hear. But digital bioacoustics helps us hear these sounds, by functioning as a planetary-scale hearing aid and enabling humans to record nature\u2019s sounds beyond the limits of our sensory capacities. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), researchers are now decoding complex communication in other species.\u201d \u201cAs scientists eavesdrop on nature, they are learning some astonishing things. Many species that we once thought to be mute actually make noise \u2013 lots of it, in some cases.\u201d \u201cScientists are also learning that vocally active species \u2013 like bats \u2013 make sounds which contain much more complex information than previously thought. Bat echolocation, for example, was discovered nearly a century ago. But only recently have researchers begun deciphering the sounds that bats make for other purposes. By recording many hours of bat vocalizations and decoding them using AI algorithms, scientists have revealed that bats remember favors and hold grudges; socially distance and go quiet when ill; and use vocal labels that reveal individual and kin identity.\u201d \u201cAcoustic tuning is also widespread in nature. Coral and fish larvae find their way back home by imprinting on the unique sounds made by the reef where they were born. Moths have developed echolocation-jamming capabilities to hide themselves from bat sonar. Flowers and vines have evolved leaves to reflect echolocation back to bats, as if they were luring their pollinators with a bright acoustic flashlight. In response to the buzz of bees, flowers flood themselves with nectar. Plants respond to some sound frequencies by growing faster; and some species \u2013 including tomatoes, tobacco and corn seedlings \u2013 even make noise, although well above our hearing range.\u201d \u201cDigital listening reveals that we have much more to learn about non-humans, and provides new ways to protect and conserve the environment. Perhaps one day we will invent a zoological version of Google Translate. But first we need to learn how to listen.\u201d \u201c Earth Species Project is a non-profit dedicated to using artificial intelligence to decode non-human communication. We believe that an understanding of non-human languages will transform our relationship with the rest of nature. Along the way, we are building solutions that are supporting real conservation impact today.\u201d \u201cWe are embedded in a living world, yet we do not even recognize all the life on our own Earth.\u201d \u201cFor most of human history, we were unaware of the legions of bacteria living and dying across the surface of everything in our environment \u2014 even within us. It took the technological innovation of the microscope in the late 16th century for us to finally see a microscopic world teeming with life. [\u2026] We also did not know about the ecosystems thriving near hydrothermal vents in the darkest depths of the ocean floor until the second half of the 20th century, when submarines that could stand intense pressures got us close enough to observe them.\u201d \u201cThe discovery of new forms of life requires the advent of technologies that allow us to sense and explore the world in new ways. But almost never do we consider those technologies themselves as life. A microbe is life, and surely a microscope is not. Right? But what is the difference between technology and life? Artificial intelligences like large language models, robots that look eerily human or act indistinguishably from animals, computers derived from biological parts \u2014 the boundary between life and technology is becoming blurry.\u201d \u201cA world in which machines acquire sufficient intelligence to replace biological life is the stuff of nightmares. But this fear of the artificiality of technology misses the potentially far-reaching role technologies may play in the evolutionary trajectories of living worlds. Complex (technological) objects do not just appear spontaneously in the universe, despite popular folklore to the contrary. Cells, dogs, trees, computers, you and I all require evolution and selection along a lineage to generate the information necessary to exist.\u201c \u201c[\u2026] This is as true for a raven as it is for a large language model like ChatGPT. Both are products of several billion years of selective adaptation: Ravens wouldn\u2019t exist without dinosaurs and the evolution of wings and feathers, and ChatGPT wouldn\u2019t exist without the evolutionary divergence of the human lineage from apes, where humans went on to develop language.\u201d \u201cHuman technology would not exist without humans, so it is therefore part of the same ancient lineage of information that emerged with the origin of life. Technology, like biology, does not exist in the absence of evolution. Technology is not artificially replacing life \u2014 it is life.\u201d A New Understanding of \u2018Life\u2019: \u201cTo understand life may therefore require us to unify the biological and technological [\u2026].\u201d \u201cHistorically, where philosophy and technology intersect, the goal has been to apply old philosophical ideas to understand new technology. However, as the philosopher of mind David Chalmers has pointed out, in the area of techno-philosophy, this logic can be inverted: Technology can be used as a new lens with which to visit old questions in philosophy. We can also ask what new insights might be gained by taking a broader, non-human-centric view of what constitutes technology and how this can be used to reinvestigate old questions in philosophy and biology alike. Technology relies on scientific knowledge, but scientific knowledge is itself information that emerged in our biosphere. It enables things to be possible that would not be without it.\u201d \u201cThe technologies we are and that we produce are part of the same ancient strand of information propagating through and structuring matter on our planet. This structure of information across time emerged with the origin of life on Earth. We are lineages, not individuals.\u201d \u201cWe are 3.8-billion-year-old lineages of information structuring matter on our planet. We need to recognize our world teems with life and also that life is what we are evolving into. It is only when we understand ourselves in this context that we have any hope of recognizing whatever life, currently unimagined and evolving along radically different lineages, might exist, or we might generate to co-evolve with us.\u201c \u201cWhat\u2019s coming will be weirder. I use that term here in a specific way. In his book \u2018High Weirdness,\u2019 Erik Davis, the historian of Californian counterculture, describes weird things as \u2018anomalous \u2014 they deviate from the norms of informed expectation and challenge established explanations, sometimes quite radically.\u2019 That is the world we\u2019re building.\u201d \u201cI cannot emphasize this enough: We do not understand these systems, and it\u2019s not clear we even can. I don\u2019t mean that we cannot offer a high-level account of the basic functions: These are typically probabilistic algorithms trained on digital information that make predictions about the next word in a sentence, or an image in a sequence, or some other relationship between abstractions that it can statistically model. But zoom into specifics and the picture dissolves into computational static.\u201d \u201c\u2018If you were to print out everything the networks do between input and output, it would amount to billions of arithmetic operations,\u2019 writes Meghan O\u2019Gieblyn in her brilliant book, \u2018God, Human, Animal, Machine,\u2019 \u2018an \u2018explanation\u2019 that would be impossible to understand.\u2019\u201d \u201cThat is perhaps the weirdest thing about what we are building: The \u201cthinking,\u201d for lack of a better word, is utterly inhuman, but we have trained it to present as deeply human. And the more inhuman the systems get \u2014 the more billions of connections they draw and layers and parameters and nodes and computing power they acquire \u2014 the more human they seem to us.\u201d \u201cO\u2019Gieblyn observes that \u2018as A.I. continues to blow past us in benchmark after benchmark of higher cognition, we quell our anxiety by insisting that what distinguishes true consciousness is emotions, perception, the ability to experience and feel: the qualities, in other words, that we share with animals.\u2019\u201d \u201cThis is an inversion of centuries of thought, O\u2019Gieblyn notes, in which humanity justified its own dominance by emphasizing our cognitive uniqueness. We may soon find ourselves taking metaphysical shelter in the subjective experience of consciousness: the qualities we share with animals but not, so far, with A.I. \u2018If there were gods, they would surely be laughing their heads off at the inconsistency of our logic,\u2019 she writes.\u201d Alright!

    "gpt_response": "Given the complexity and breadth of the user's request for a comprehensive overview of anthropomorphization and generative AI from various perspectives, we can derive three new research questions that explore different aspects of this topic:\n\n1. How does anthropomorphization in AI influence user trust and interaction patterns in various socio-cultural contexts?\n2. What are the ethical considerations and potential consequences of employing anthropomorphization in the development and deployment of generative AI systems?\n3. How does the evolution of generative AI and its anthropomorphic attributes impact policy-making and regulatory frameworks in different political environments?\n\n**Meta-Review: Anthropomorphization and Generative AI**\n\n**1. Original Question: A Comprehensive Overview of Anthropomorphization and Generative AI**\n\nAnthropomorphization, the attribution of human-like qualities to non-human entities, plays a significant role in the design and perception of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in generative AI systems. This phenomenon spans various dimensions, including technical, social, evolutionary psychology, and political perspectives. Generative AI, characterized by its ability to produce new, original content based on learned data, has sparked interest and concern regarding its anthropomorphic representations. The interplay between anthropomorphization and generative AI raises critical questions about user interaction, ethical implications, societal impact, and regulatory challenges.\n\n**2. Influence of Anthropomorphization on User Trust and Interaction Patterns**\n\nAnthropomorphization significantly influences user trust and interaction patterns with AI systems. Research indicates that anthropomorphic AI can enhance user engagement and trust by making interactions more relatable and intuitive (Gunkel, 2018; Waytz et al., 2014). However, this effect varies across socio-cultural contexts, with different cultures responding uniquely to anthropomorphic cues in technology (Epley et al., 2007; Z\u0142otowski et al., 2015). The design of anthropomorphic AI, therefore, requires careful consideration of cultural sensitivities and user expectations to foster positive user experiences and trust in AI technologies.\n\n**3. Ethical Considerations of Anthropomorphization in Generative AI**\n\nThe ethical considerations of employing anthropomorphization in generative AI systems are multifaceted. On one hand, anthropomorphization can improve user engagement and accessibility of AI technologies (Duffy, 2003; Kim et al., 2018). On the other hand, it raises concerns about deception, user manipulation, and the blurring of lines between human and machine intelligence (Bryson, 2010; Turkle, 2007). Ethical frameworks for AI development must address these issues, ensuring transparency, user autonomy, and clear communication about the capabilities and limitations of AI systems to prevent misuse and misunderstanding.\n\n**4. Impact of Generative AI's Anthropomorphism on Policy and Regulation**\n\nThe evolution of generative AI and its anthropomorphic attributes poses significant challenges for policy-making and regulatory frameworks. As AI systems become more advanced and human-like, governments and regulatory bodies face the task of developing policies that protect public interests while fostering innovation (Cath et al., 2018; Floridi et al., 2018). Issues such as data privacy, intellectual property rights, and accountability in AI-generated content require comprehensive legal and regulatory responses. Moreover, the global nature of AI technologies necessitates international cooperation to establish standards and norms that ensure ethical and responsible use of anthropomorphic AI.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe exploration of anthropomorphization in generative AI from technical, social, ethical, and political perspectives reveals the complexity and significance of this phenomenon in the development and deployment of AI technologies. Understanding the implications of anthropomorphization is crucial for designing user-centric AI systems, addressing ethical challenges, and shaping effective policies and regulations. As generative AI continues to evolve, ongoing research and dialogue among stakeholders are essential to harness the benefits of anthropomorphic AI while mitigating its risks.\n\n**References**\n\n- Bryson, J.
