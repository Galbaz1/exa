            "summary": "The estate of George Carlin has sued Dudesy and podcast hosts Will Sasso and Chad Kultgen for creating an AI-generated comedy special titled \u201cGeorge Carlin: I\u2019m Glad I\u2019m Dead,\u201d alleging it infringes on Carlin\u2019s publicity rights and copyright. Filed in Los Angeles, the lawsuit demands the removal of the special, which uses AI to mimic Carlin\u2019s voice and style, discussing modern topics. Carlin\u2019s daughter criticized the special as an exploitation of her father\u2019s legacy. The plaintiffs argue the special violates copyright, as it replicates Carlin\u2019s unique expression without permission. The case highlights growing legal challenges against unauthorized use of celebrity likenesses through AI technology."
